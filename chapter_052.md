FIFTY-TWO
Wukong greatly disturbed the Golden Helmet Cave
Tathāgata reveals in secret the true master
We were telling you about the Great Sage Sun, who recovered his goldenhooped rod and fought his way out of the door. He was filled with delight as he leaped
up to the tall summit to face the various gods. “How did you do this time?” asked the
Devarāja Li. “By his transformation,” said Pilgrim, “old Monkey managed to get inside
the cave. That fiend and his subordinates were all singing and dancing, drinking their
victory wine. I did not succeed in detecting where he put his treasure, but when I went
to the rear of the cave, I heard horses neighing and dragons whining and I knew that
they had to be the belongings of the fire department. The golden-hooped rod was
leaning against the east wall; old Monkey picked it up and fought his way out.”
“You got your treasure,” said the deities, “but when could we get back ours?”
“It‟s easy! It‟s easy!” said Pilgrim. “When I have this iron rod, I‟ll strike him
down and recover your treasures for you, no matter what.”
Hardly had he finished speaking when they heard a great din coming from below
the mountain slope punctuated by the roll of drums and the sounding of gongs. The
Bovine Great King, you see, was leading the various spirits to give chase to Pilgrim,
who, when he saw the throng approaching, shouted:
“Good! Good! Good! This is exactly my wish! Have a seat, all of you, and let
old Monkey go again to catch him.”
Dear Great Sage! Lifting high his iron rod, he met them head-on, crying,
“Brazen demon, where are you going? Watch my rod!” Using his lance to parry the
blow, the fiend scolded him:
“You thievish ape! You‟re indeed ill-behaved! How dare you rob me in broad
daylight?”
“You cursed beast!” said Pilgrim. “You don‟t know that you‟re about to die.
You are the one who robbed us in broad daylight with your fillet. Which of these things
really belongs to you? Don‟t run away. Have a taste of your Venerable Father‟s rod!”
What a great battle this was!
The Great Sage displays his might;
The demon‟s no longer tame.
The two wage a fierce contest,
For neither‟s willing to quit.
This one‟s iron rod seems like a dragon‟s tail;
That one‟s long lance resembles a python‟s head.
From this one, the strokes of the rod roar like the wind;
From that one, the blows of the lance flow like strong currents.
You see colored mists close in to darken the peaks
And auspicious clouds hover o‟er the woods.
The birds in the air all stop their wings;
The beasts in the wilds all hide their heads.
678
678
On the battlefield the little fiends cheer;
On this side the Great Sage rouses himself.
His one iron rod that none can withstand
Has fought throughout the West‟s ten thousand miles.
But that long lance is truthfully his match,
E‟re ruling Golden Helmet with all success.
They meet this time and they won‟t leave in peace;
Till one obtains a victory they‟ll never cease.
For three hours the demon king fought with the Great Sage Sun, but no decision
could be reached. Soon it was getting dark. Using the lance to hold back the rod, the
demon said, “Wukong, you stop now. When it‟s dark everywhere, it‟s no time to fight.
Let‟s each of us take some rest. We‟ll resume our contest tomorrow morning.”
“Shut up, you lawless beast!” scolded Pilgrim. “Old Monkey‟s just getting
inspired! Who cares if it‟s getting late! I‟m determined to find out which of us is better.”
With a shout, however, the fiend turned and fled, leading all those fiends and their arms
back into the cave, after which they had the door tightly shut.
As the Great Sage walked back to the peak with his rod trailing behind him, the
Heaven deities all congratulated him with these words:
“Truly a mighty power Equal to Heaven! What boundless, what limitless
powers!”
“Thanks for the compliments! Thanks for the compliments!” said Pilgrim. “We
haven‟t exaggerated in our praise,” said Devarāja Li, drawing near. “You are indeed
quite a man! The way you fought just now reminded us of the time when you defied the
cosmic nets.”
“Let‟s not revive old gossip,” said Pilgrim.
“After he had fought with old Monkey all this while, that fiend must be tired. I
won‟t complain of fatigue; while all of you sit here and relax, I want to go into the cave
to find out where he has hidden that fillet of his. I‟m determined to steal it and to catch
the fiend. Then we can find your weapons so that you all may return to Heaven.”
“It‟s getting late,” said the prince. “Why not rest for the night and go there
tomorrow morning?” Laughing, Pilgrim said, “Our little boy is still ignorant of the ways
of the world! Who has ever seen a thief starting something in daytime? To sneak inside,
one must go during the night, undetected; that‟s how this business is done!”
Both Fiery Virtue and one of the thunder squires said, “Don‟t talk anymore,
Third Prince. This sort of thing may be foreign to us, but the Great Sage is an expert. He
has to make use of this time, for the demon is tired and his guard may be down during
the night. Let the Great Sage go now. Go quickly!”
Dear Great Sage! Grinning broadly, he put away his iron rod and leaped down
from the tall summit to go once more before the cave.
He shook his body once and immediately changed into a small cricket. Truly he
has
Hard mouth, long whiskers, and black skin,
With keen eyes and legs forked like branches.
Midst bright moon and clear breeze he chirps on the wall,
Like someone speaking in silent night.
679
679
He weeps when dew saddens prospect,
A proud voice, though halting and faint.
The window‟s pensive guest dreads hearing him,
This lodger ‟neath the steps or the bed.
Stretching forth his long legs, he jumped up to the door with three or four leaps
and crawled inside through a crack. He squatted near the foot of the wall and, by the
light of lamps and torches inside, looked carefully around. The various fiends, young
and old, were just wolfing down their dinners. Pilgrim creaked and cricked for a while,
and soon after, the fiends finished eating and put away their utensils. After laying out
their bedding, all the fiends retired. Not until the time of the first watch did Pilgrim go
to the rear chamber, where he heard the old demon give this command:
“All the little ones guarding the doors should sleep lightly. I fear that Sun
Wukong may change into something to come in here to steal again.”
Those who were taking turns to stand watch began to beat their rattles or ring
their bells. Our Great Sage, however, was most eager to do what he came to do! After
he crawled into the bedroom, he found a stone bed, on both sides of which were several
mountain ghosts or tree spirits all powdered and rouged. They were making the bed and
helping the old demon to retire; some were unlacing his boots while others were untying
his robe. After the demon king took off his clothes, at once the fillet—all ghostly
white—could be seen. It was attached to his left shoulder like an armlet made of a string
of pearls. Look at him! Instead of taking the fillet off, he pushed it up a couple of times
until it was snugly clamped to his shoulder. Only then did he lie down to sleep. With
one shake of his body again, Pilgrim changed into a flea with yellow skin. Leaping onto
the stone bed and crawling inside his covers, he crept up to the left shoulder of the fiend
and gave him a sturdy bite. The fiend was so stung by it that he turned over, shouting,
“These slaves! They ought to be beaten more often! They didn‟t shake the covers, nor
did they brush the bedding. Now I‟ve been bitten by I don‟t know what!”
He gave his fillet two further shoves before dozing off once more. Crawling
above the fillet, Pilgrim gave him another bite. Unable to sleep, the fiend sat up, yelling,
“I‟m itching to death!” When Pilgrim saw how carefully he guarded the fillet, refusing
to let it leave his body for even a moment, Pilgrim knew that he would not be able to
steal it. He leaped down from the bed, changed once more into a cricket, and left the
bedroom to go to the rear, where he again heard dragons whining and horses neighing.
Behind two doors tightly locked, you see, fire dragons and fire horses all hung inside.
Pilgrim changed back to his original form as he walked up to the door to exercise his
lock-opening magic. He recited a spell and gave the padlock a wipe: immediately the
double patches snapped open. Pushing open the doors, he walked into a room so
brightly lit by fire equipment that it seemed like daylight. Several weapons were seen
leaning against the east and the west walls: they were the fiend-slashing scimitar of the
prince, the fire bows and fire arrows of Fiery Virtue, and the like. In the glow of the
light, Pilgrim looked carefully around and saw on top of a stone table behind the door a
small basket woven of bamboo. Inside was placed a bunch of hairs. Filled with delight,
the Great Sage picked up the hairs and blew on them two mouthfuls of hot air, crying,
“Change!”
They changed at once into forty or fifty little monkeys, who were then told to
pick up the scimitar, the sword, the club, the wheel, together with the bows, the arrows,
the lances, the carts, the gourds, the fire crows, the fire rats, and the fire horses—all
those things sucked away by the fillet. After they had mounted the fire dragons, they
680
680
started a huge blaze that burned outward from deep inside the cave. All you could hear
were the snapping and cracking—bing-bing, bang-bang—as if thunderbolts or fire
cannons were let loose inside. Those monster-spirits, young and old, were utterly
terrified; in a stupor, they hugged their blankets or covered their heads, some screaming,
some weeping. None of them knew which way to run and more than half of them were
burned to death by the fire. The Handsome Monkey King thus returned to his camp in
triumph at about the hour of the third watch.
We now tell you about Devarāja Li and his companions on the tall summit. They
suddenly saw a bright flare of lights rushing toward them, and then they discovered
Pilgrim riding on a dragon and shouting commands to a team of little monkeys as they
ascended the mountain. After reaching the peak, he yelled:
“Come and get your weapons! Come and get your weapons!”
Fiery Virtue and Naṭa immediately answered his call, while Pilgrim shook his
body to retrieve his hairs. Prince Naṭa took back his six weapons, and Fiery Virtue told
his subordinates to put away the fire dragons and other equipment. All of them were full
of smiles and praises for Pilgrim, and we shall leave them there for the moment.
We tell you instead about the Golden Helmet Cave, where flames were still
shooting up everywhere. The Bovine Great King was scared out of his wits; dashing out
of his room, he held his fillet up high with both hands. He pushed it toward the fire this
way and that way, and it immediately went out. Though the air was filled with flame
and smoke, they all subsided after he and his treasure had run through the entire cave.
He tried to rescue the other fiends, but over half of them had been burned to death.
Those who survived, male and female, did not number a hundred. Then he went to
inspect the place where he had hidden the weapons, but not a single item could be
found. Finally, he reached the rear of the cave where he saw Eight Rules, Sha Monk,
and the elder still securely bound. The white dragon horse was tied to the stall, and even
the load of luggage remained in the room. Angrily, the demon said, “I wonder which of
the little fiends was so careless that he started the fire and brought all this on us!”
“Great King,” one of the attendants by his side said, “This fire could not have
been started by any one of our own. It had to be the work of someone intent on raiding
our camp; after he had released the equipment of the fire department, he also stole the
divine weapons.” Only then did the old demon realize what had happened. “There is no
one else!” he said. “It has to be that thief, Sun Wukong! No wonder I had such a hard
time when I tried to sleep just now! That larcenous ape must have gotten in here by
means of transformation and gave my shoulder a couple of bites.
Undoubtedly he wanted to steal my treasure, but when he saw how tightly it was
attached to my body, he could not do it. That was the reason he stole the other weapons
instead and let loose the fire dragons. How vicious of him! He wanted to burn me to
death! Oh thievish ape! You‟ve made vain use of your trickery! When I have this
treasure on me, I can‟t be drowned even when I plunge into the ocean, nor can I be
burned if I leap into a pool of fire. But when I catch you, thief, this time, I‟m going to
skin and cut you up alive.
Only then will I be satisfied.”
He spoke sullenly in this manner for a long time, and soon thereafter it was
dawn. On the tall summit, the prince, holding his six weapons that had just been
recovered, said to Pilgrim, “Great Sage, it‟s getting bright. Let‟s not wait any further.
We should make use of this opportunity when that demon‟s will to fight has been
681
681
blunted by you. With the help of the fire department, let us go again to do battle with
him. Most probably he‟ll be captured this time.”
“You are right,” said Pilgrim, chuckling. “Let us unite and go have some fun!”
In high spirits and eager to fight, each of them went up to the cave entrance. “Lawless
demon, come out!” bellowed Pilgrim. “Come and fight with old Monkey!”
The two stone doors of the cave, you see, had been reduced to ashes the night
before by the intense heat.
At the moment, several little fiends by the entrance were just in the process of
gathering up the ashes and sweeping the ground. When they saw the various sages
approach, they were so terrified that they abandoned their brooms and ash forks and
dashed inside to report:
“Sun Wukong has led many gods to provoke battle outside our door!” So
astounded was he by this report that the bovine fiend gnashed his teeth and rolled his
ringlike eyes. He picked up his lance and his treasure, and no sooner had he emerged
from the door when he began to castigate his adversary, saying, “You thievish ape! You
camp-raider and arsonist! What skills do you have that you dare treat me so
contemptuously?” Smiling broadly, Pilgrim said, “You brazen fiend! If you want to
know my skills, come up here and listen to my recital.
My skills were great since the time of my birth,
As was my name throughout the universe.
Enlightened, I practiced the transcendent way;
In days past came the means to eternal youth.
I willed to bow at the place of the Heart,
To seek with reverence the home of a sage.
I learned how to change with endless power,
Taking as my playground the whole cosmos.
At leisure I tamed tigers on the mount;
When bored I subdued dragons in the sea.
I claimed a throne at native Flower- Fruit,
Flaunting my strength in Water-Curtain Cave.
A few times I lusted for Heaven‟s realm;
Ignorant, I robbed the Region Above.
My royal name: Great Sage, Equal to Heaven;
I was called also Handsome Monkey King.
When the Feast of Peaches was under way,
I took offense for no invitation came.
In secret I stole jade juice at Jasper Pool
And drank it in stealth at the treasure tower.
Dragon and phoenix organs I did taste;
A hundred dainties I would steal and eat.
Millennial peaches I freely enjoyed,
Stuffing my guts with long-life drugs and pills.
Strange things of Heav‟n I took piece by piece,
And rare goods from sage mansions bit by bit.
When Jade Emperor learned what great skills I had,
He sent divine soldiers to the battlefield.
I banished those fierce Nine Luminaries;
682
682
And wounded the Five Quarters‟ Vicious Stars.
All Heaven‟s warriors were no match of mine;
A hundred thousand troops dared not meet me.
Hard pressed, the Jade Emperor gave a decree:
Libation Stream‟s Little Sage then raised his sword.
Seventy-two transformations we struggled through,
Each rousing his spirit, each showing his might.
Guanyin of South Sea came, too, at length
To lend them her help with willow and vase.
Laozi then made use of his diamond snare
To have me captured and brought up there
To see, bound firmly, the Great Emperor Jade,
As judge and tribunal indicted me.
They told God Powerful to cut me dead,
But sparks flew up when knives fell on my head.
Since no means was found to put me to death,
They sent me all shackled to Laozi‟s hall:
A brazier, watched by the Six Gods of Light,
Refined me till I became hard as steel.
With vessel opened on day forty-ninth,
I leaped out to work violence yet once more.
When gods hid themselves and none withstood me,
The sages agreed that Buddha be called.
Tathāgata‟s power was mighty indeed!
His wisdom, truly vast and limitless!
A somersault match waged upon his hand
Made a mountain press me, now no more strong.
When the Emperor gave the Feast of Heaven‟s Peace,
The West regained its name of Ultimate Bliss.
Old Monkey jailed for full five hundred years
Did not once taste a bit of tea or rice.
But when Elder Gold Cicada came to earth,
The East sent him to go to Buddha‟s home
To fetch true scriptures for a noble state,
Where the Great Tang ruler might save the dead.
Guanyin taught me to submit to the Good
And let faith held firmly my wildness check.
Free of my ordeal at that mountain root,
I now go West to fetch the scripture texts.
Lawless demon, cease your foxlike cunning!
Return my Tang Monk, bow to Dharma King!”
When he heard these words, he pointed at Pilgrim and cried, “So, you were the
big thief who robbed Heaven! Don‟t run away! Swallow my lance!”
The Great Sage met him with the rod and the two of them began to fight. On this
side Prince Naṭa became angry and the Star of Fiery Virtue grew vicious: they hurled
those six divine weapons together with the fire equipment at the demon. The Great Sage
Sun fought even more fiercely as the thunder squires took up their thunderbolts and the
devarāja his scimitar to rush at their enemy. Smiling scornfully, the demon calmly took
683
683
out from his sleeve his treasure and tossed it in the air, crying, “Hit!” With a loud
whoosh, the six divine weapons, the fire equipment, the thunderbolts, the scimitar of the
devarāja, and the rod of Pilgrim were all snatched away. Once again, the deities and the
Great Sage Sun were empty-handed. After the demon returned in triumph to his cave, he
gave this order:
“Little ones, gather rocks and boulders to rebuild our doors, and tidy up our
rooms and hallways. When we finish our work, we shall slaughter the Tang Monk and
his companions to thank the Earth. Then all of us can disperse the blessing and enjoy.”
The little fiends all obeyed, and we shall leave them for the moment.
We tell you now about the Devarāja Li, who led the rest of the gods back to the
tall summit. Fiery Virtue then began to rail at Naṭa for being too impulsive, while the
thunder squires blamed the devarāja for acting too recklessly. Water Lord, however,
stood to one side and sulked. When Pilgrim saw how distraught they looked, he had
little alternative but to appear cheerful and said to them, forcing a smile, “Please don‟t
be so distressed, all of you. After all, the ancient proverb says, „Victory or defeat is a
common thing for the soldier.‟ If we want to consider the demon‟s fighting skill, it‟s no
more than so-so. The reason he can cause so much harm is that fillet in his possession,
which has again sucked away all our weapons. Nonetheless, try to relax. Let old
Monkey go and see if he can find out something more about his pedigree.”
“When you first presented your memorial to the Jade Emperor,” said the prince,
“there was a thorough search made throughout the celestial realm, but not a trace of this
monster could be found. Now where are you going to make further investigation?”
Pilgrim replied, “Come to think of it, the dharma power of Buddha is boundless. I shall
go now to the Western Heaven to question our Buddha Tathāgata; I shall ask him to
scan with his eye of wisdom the four great continents of Earth and see where this fiend
was born and raised. I want to learn what sort of treasure his fillet is, and no matter
what, I‟m determined to have him arrested. Only then will all of you be avenged and
have a happy trip back to Heaven.”
“If that‟s your intention,” said the gods, “don‟t delay. Go quickly! Go quickly!”
Dear Pilgrim! He said he would go, and at once he mounted his cloudsomersault. Instantly he arrived at the Spirit Mountain.
Lowering his auspicious luminosity, he looked everywhere. Marvelous place!
The noble Mount Spirit,
Fine, pure cloud-layers;
A divine summit touching jade-green sky.
A great town seen in Western Heaven,
Its form, its air surpassing even China‟s.
The primal breath flows to widen Heav‟n and Earth;
Strong wind scatters a platform full of flowers.
Long notes of bells and stones are often heard,
And clear, loud scripture recitations.
You see, too, lay-sisters lecturing beneath green pines
And arhats walking among jadelike cedars.
White cranes with feelings come to Vulture Peak;
Blue phoenixes wish to stand by quiet arbors.
Black apes in pairs hold up immortal fruits;
684
684
Aged deer in twos present purple blooms.
Rare birds call often like some tale-telling,
And flowers too strange and fair to have names.
The ranges turn and circle, fold upon fold;
The old path meanders, though it‟s level.
A place where pure void of spirit‟s the norm—
Buddha‟s solemn and great awakened form.
As Pilgrim enjoyed the sight of the mountain scenery, he heard someone calling
him:
“Sun Wukong, where did you come from? Where are you going?”
He turned quickly and found that it was the Honored One Bhikṣuṇi.
The Great Sage greeted her and said, “I have a matter that requires an audience
with Tathāgata.”
“You rascal!” said Bhikṣuṇi, “if you want to see Tathāgata, why don‟t you
ascend the treasure temple? Why stay here to look at the mountain?”
“This is the first time I have been to this noble region,” replied Pilgrim, “and
that‟s why I am acting boldly.”
“Follow me quickly,” said Bhikṣuṇi, and Pilgrim ran after her up to the gate of
the Thunderclap Monastery, where their way was barred by the heroic figures of the
Eight Great Diamond Guardians.
“Wukong,” said Bhikṣuṇi, “wait here for a moment and let me announce your
arrival.” Pilgrim had no choice but to wait outside the gate. Going before the Buddha,
Bhikṣuṇi pressed her palms before her and said, “Sun Wukong needs to have an
audience with Tathāgata.” Whereupon Tathāgata commanded him to enter, and only
then did the diamond guardians allow him to pass.
After Pilgrim touched his head to the ground, Tathāgata asked, “Wukong, I
heard previously that after the Honored One Guanyin had freed you, you made
submission to Buddhism and agreed to accompany the Tang Monk to seek scriptures
here. Why have you come all by yourself? What is the matter?”
Again touching his head to the ground, Pilgrim said, “Let me report this to our
Buddha.
Since your disciple embraced the faith, he has followed the master from the
Tang court in his journey west. We reached the Golden Helmet Cave of the Golden
Helmet Mountain, where we ran into an evil demon, who had the name of Bovine Great
King. He had such vast magic powers that he abducted my master and brothers into his
cave. Your disciple demanded their return, but he had no good will at all and we fought
it out. My iron rod was snatched away by a ghostly white fillet of his. As I suspected
that he might be some celestial warrior who longed for the world, I went to the Region
Above to investigate. The Jade Emperor was kind enough to lend me the assistance of
the father-and-son team of Devarāja Li, only to have him rob the prince of his six
weapons. Then I asked the Star of Fiery Virtue to burn him with fire, but he took the fire
equipment also. Next we asked the Star of Watery Virtue to drown him with water, but
we couldn‟t even touch a single hair of his. After your disciple spent enormous energy
to steal back the iron rod and other things, we went again to provoke battle. Once again
his fillet sucked away all our weapons, and we are powerless to subdue him.
685
685
That‟s why I have this special request for our Buddha, in his great compassion,
to survey the world and find out what is the true origin of this creature. I shall then be
able to capture his kin or neighbor so that it will facilitate the arrest of the demon and
the rescue of my master. All of us then will be able to bow, with palms pressed together
and with utter sincerity, to seek the right fruit.”
After Tathāgata heard this, he trained his eyes of wisdom to peer into the
distance and immediately he had knowledge of the whole affair. “Though I‟ve learned
the identity of that fiendish creature,” he said to Pilgrim, “I can‟t reveal it to you
because you have such a loose, apish tongue. If somehow you pass on the fact that it
was I who disclosed his identity, he would not fight with you but he would start a
quarrel up here in Spirit Mountain. That would cause me a lot of trouble. Let me give
you the assistance of my dharma power instead to help you capture him.”
Bowing deeply again, Pilgrim thanked him and said, “What sort of dharma
power will you bestow on me?”
Tathāgata immediately ordered the Eighteen Arhats to open the treasury and
take out eighteen grains of golden cinnabar sand to assist Wukong. “What will this
golden cinnabar sand do?” asked Pilgrim. “Go before the cave,” said Tathāgata, “and
ask the demon for a contest. Entice him to come out and the arhats will at once release
the sand, which will entrap him. Since he won‟t be able to move his body or raise his
feet, you can beat him up at will.”
“Wonderful! Wonderful!” cried Pilgrim, laughing. “Bring them out quickly!”
Not daring to delay, the arhats at once took out the golden cinnabar sand and walked out
of the gate. After Pilgrim thanked Tathāgata again, he ran after the crowd and found
there were only sixteen arhats. “What sort of a place is this,” yelled Pilgrim, “that you
are taking bribes and releasing prisoners?”
“Who is taking bribes and releasing prisoners?” asked the arhats, and Pilgrim
said, “Originally eighteen of you were sent. Why is it that there are only sixteen now?”
Hardly had he finished speaking when Dragon Subduer and Tiger Tamer, the
two Honored Ones, walked out from inside. “Wukong,” they said, “how could you be so
mischievous? The two of us remained behind because Tathāgata had further instructions
for us.”
“That‟s a wretched way to take bribes!” said Pilgrim. “If I waited even a
moment in hollering, you probably would not come out.” Laughing uproariously, the
arhats mounted the auspicious clouds.
In a moment, they arrived at the Golden Helmet Mountain, where they were met
by Devarāja Li leading the rest of the deities. “No need to go into the details,” said one
of the arhats. “Go quickly and ask him to come out.”
Holding his fists high, our Great Sage went before the cave entrance and
shouted, “Blubbery fiend! Come out quickly and try your hands with your Grandpa
Sun.”
Again those little fiends dashed inside to make the report. Infuriated, the demon
king said, “This thievish ape! I wonder whom he has invited to come make a nuisance
here!”
“There‟s no other warrior,” said the little fiends, “he‟s all by himself.”
686
686
“I‟ve already taken away his rod,” said the demon king. “How is it that he shows
up all by himself again? Could it be that he wants to box some more?” Picking up his
treasure and his lance, he ordered the little fiends to move away the boulders and leaped
out of the cave. “Larcenous ape!” he scolded.
“For several times you haven‟t been able to gain the upper hand, and that should
make you stay away. Why are you here again making noises?” Pilgrim said, “This
brazen demon doesn‟t know good or evil! If you don‟t want your Grandpa to show up at
your door, you make submission, apologize, and send out my master and brothers. Then
I‟ll spare you.”
“Those three monks of yours,” said the fiend, “have been scrubbed clean. Soon
they will be slaughtered. And you are still making a fuss? Go away!” When Pilgrim
heard the word “slaughter,” fire leaped up to his cheeks. Unable to suppress the anger of
his heart, he wielded his fists and attacked the demon with hooks and jabs. Spreading
out his long lance, the fiend turned to meet him. Pilgrim jumped this way and that to
deceive the monster. Not knowing it was a trick, the demon left the entrance of the cave
and gave chase toward the south. At once Pilgrim shouted for the arhats to pour the
golden cinnabar sand down on the demon. Marvelous sand! Truly,
Like fog, like mist, it spreads out at first;
In great profusion it drops from afar.
One mass of white
Blinding vision every where.
A dark expanse
Flaring up to lead you astray.
The working woodsman has lost his partner;
The fairy youth picking herbs can‟t see his home.
It drifts and soars like fine wheat-flour;
Some grains are coarse like sesame.
The world seems opaque as the summits darken;
The sun‟s hidden and the sky disappears.
It‟s not quite the noise and dust at a horse‟s heels,
Nor the light fluffiness chasing a scented car.
This sand is by nature a ruthless thing
Which can blot out the world to seize the fiend.
Because a demon assails the right Way,
The arhats by Law release their power.
Though your hand may hold a bright shiny pearl,
Soon the blown sand will your eyesight obscure.
When the demon saw that the flying sand was clouding up his vision, he lowered
his head and discovered that his feet were already standing in three feet of the stuff. He
was so horrified that he tried to jump upward; before he could even stand up properly
the sand grew another foot. In desperation, the fiend tried to pull up his legs while
taking out his fillet. Throwing it up into the air, he cried, “Hit!” With a loud whoosh, the
eighteen grains of golden cinnabar sand were sucked away. The demon then strode back
to the cave.
All of those arhats with bare hands stopped their clouds, while Pilgrim drew near
and asked, “Why are you not sending down the sand?”
687
687
“There was a sound just now,” one of them said, “and instantly our golden
cinnabar sand vanished.”
“That little something has sucked them away again!” sighed Pilgrim with a
laugh. “If he‟s so hard to catch,” said Devarāja Li to the rest, “how could we ever arrest
him? When will we be able to return to Heaven? How could we face the Emperor?” On
one side, Dragon Subduer and Tiger Tamer, the two arhats, said, “Wukong, did you
know why we delayed in coming out of the door just now?”
“Old Monkey only feared that you were trying to find some pretense not to
come,” said Pilgrim. “I don‟t know any other explanation.” One of the two arhats
replied, “Tathāgata told the two of us that the demon had vast magic powers. If we lost
the golden cinnabar sand, he said, we should ask Sun Wukong to search for his origin at
the place of Laozi, the Tushita Palace of the Griefless Heaven. The demon would be
caught with one stroke.” When Pilgrim heard this, he said, “That‟s most despicable!
Even Tathāgata is trying to hornswoggle old Monkey! He should have told me right
then and there, and there would have been no need for all of you to travel.”
“If Tathāgata made such a clear revelation,” said Devarāja Li, “let the Great
Sage go up there quickly.”
Dear Pilgrim! “I‟m off!” he said, and at once he mounted the cloud somersault
to enter the South Heaven Gate. There he was met by the four grand marshals, who
raised their folded hands to their chins to salute him, asking, “How‟s the affair of
arresting that monster?”
Answering them as he walked along, Pilgrim said, “It‟s unfinished! It‟s
unfinished! But I‟m on his trail now!”
The four grand marshals dared not detain him and permitted him to walk inside
the Heaven Gate. Going neither to the Hall of Divine Mists nor to the Dipper Palace, he
went instead straight up to the Tushita Palace of the Griefless Heaven, which was
beyond the thirty-third Heaven. Two immortal youths were standing outside the palace.
Without announcing who he was, however, Pilgrim walked right inside the door, so
startling the youths that they tugged at him, crying, “Who are you? Where are you
going?” Only then did Pilgrim say, “I‟m the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven. I wish to see
Laozi, Mr. Li.”
“Why are you so rude?” asked one of the youths. “Stand here and let us
announce you.”
But Pilgrim would have none of that. With a shout, he dashed inside and ran
smack into Laozi, who was just coming out.
Bowing low hurriedly, Pilgrim said, “Venerable Sir, haven‟t seen you for
awhile.”
“Why is this ape not going to seek scriptures?” said Laozi, chuckling. “What‟s
he doing here?” Pilgrim replied,
Scripture-seeking—
Toil unending.
My way was blocked:
I came shuffling.
“If the road to the Western Heaven is blocked,” said Laozi, “what has that got to
do with me?”

Again Pilgrim said,
Ah, Heaven West!
Stop your protest!
I find my trail:
You I‟ll contest.
“This place of mine,” said Laozi, “is an incomparable immortal palace. What
sort of trail can you find?”
Eyes unblinking, Pilgrim went inside and looked left and right. He walked past
several corridors and all at once he discovered a boy sound asleep by the corral. The
green buffalo, however, was not inside. “Venerable Sir,” said Pilgrim, “your buffalo has
escaped! Your buffalo has escaped!”
“When did this cursed beast escape?” asked Laozi, highly astonished. All that
clamor woke up the boy, who immediately went to his knees and said, “Father, your
disciple fell asleep. I don‟t know when he escaped.”
“How could you fall asleep, you rogue?” scolded Laozi. The boy kowtowed
several times before he answered, “Your disciple picked up one pellet of elixir in the
elixir chamber. As soon as I ate it, I fell asleep.”
“It must be the Elixir of Seven Returns to the Fire that we made the other day.
One pellet fell out, and this rogue picked it up and ate it. Well, anyone who eats one of
those pellets will sleep for seven days. Because you fell asleep, no one looked after that
cursed beast, and he took the opportunity to go to the Region Below. Today is the
seventh day.” Immediately Laozi wanted to make an investigation to see if any treasure
was stolen, but Pilgrim said, “He doesn‟t have any treasure except a fillet, and it is quite
formidable.” Laozi made a quick inventory; everything was there except the diamond
snare. “This cursed beast stole my diamond snare!” said Laozi. “So, that‟s the treasure!”
said Pilgrim. “It was the same snare that hit me that time!
Now it‟s going wild down below, sucking away who knows how many things.”
“Where‟s the cursed beast now?” asked Laozi. Pilgrim replied, “At the Golden
Helmet Cave of the Golden Helmet Mountain. He caught my Tang Monk first and
robbed me of my golden-hooped rod. When I asked the celestial soldiers to come help
me, he also took away the divine weapons of the prince. When the Star of Fiery Virtue
arrived, his equipment was also taken. Only Water Lord did not lose anything to him,
but his water could not drown the demon either. Finally, I asked Tathāgata to order the
arhats to use sand, but even that golden Cinnabar sand was snatched away. When
someone like you, Venerable Sir, lets loose a fiendish creature to rob and harm people,
with what kind of crime should we charge him?” Laozi said, “That diamond snare of
mine is a treasure perfected since the time of my youth, and it was also an instrument
with which I converted the barbarians when I passed through the Hangu Pass.
Whatever weapons you may have, including fire and water, you can‟t touch it. If
the demon had stolen my plantain-leaf fan also, then even I would not be able to do
anything to him.”
Thereafter, Laozi took up his plantain-leaf fan and mounted the auspicious
cloud, followed by a happy Great Sage. They left the celestial palace, went through the
South Heaven Gate, and lowered their clouds on the Golden Helmet Mountain. There
they were met by the eighteen arhats, the thunder squires, Water Lord, Fiery Virtue, and
Devarāja Li and his son, to whom they gave a thorough account of what had taken
689

place. “Sun Wukong,” said Laozi, “may go again to entice him to come out; I‟ll put him
away then.” Jumping down from the summit, Pilgrim again shouted, “You cursed
blubbery beast! Come out quickly and submit to death!” Once more the little fiends
went inside to report, and the old demon said, “This larcenous ape has asked someone to
come again.” Quickly he took up his lance and treasure and walked out of the door.
“You brazen demon!” scolded Pilgrim. “This time you will die for sure! Don‟t run
away. Have a taste of my palm!”
He leaped right onto the chest of the demon and gave him a terrific whack on the
ear before turning to flee. Wielding his lance, the demon gave chase, only to hear
someone calling on the tall summit:
“If that little buffalo doesn‟t come home now, what‟s he waiting for?” When the
demon raised his head and saw that it was Laozi, his heart shook and his gall quivered.
“This thievish ape,” he said, “is truly a devil of the Earth! How did he manage to find
my master?” Reciting a spell, Laozi fanned the air once with his fan. The fiend threw
the fillet at Laozi, who caught it immediately and gave him another fan. All at once the
fiend‟s strength fled him and his tendons turned numb; he changed back into his original
form, which was that of a green buffalo. Blowing a mouthful of divine breath on the
diamond snare, Laozi then used it to pierce the nostrils of the fiend.
Next, he took off the sash around his waist and fastened one end of it to the
snare while his hand held the other. Thus the custom of leading the buffalo with a ring
in its nose was established, a custom in use even now. This is also what we call binlang.
After he took leave of the various deities, Laozi climbed onto the back of his
green buffalo.
Mounting colored clouds,
He went back to Tushita Palace;
Having bound the fiend,
He ascended to the Griefless Heaven.
Then the Great Sage Sun fought his way with the other deities into the cave and
slaughtered all the remaining little fiends, some one hundred of them. Each of the gods
recovered his weapons, after which the father-and-son team of Devarāja Li went back to
Heaven; the thunder squires to their mansions; Fiery Virtue to his palace; Water Lord to
his rivers; and the arhats to the West. Pilgrim then took back his iron rod and untied the
Tang Monk, Eight Rules, and Sha Monk, who also gave thanks to him. After they got
the horse and the luggage ready, master and disciples left the cave and found the main
road to journey once more.
As they proceeded, they heard someone by the road calling, “Holy Tang Monk,
eat the food first before you go.”
The elder was terribly frightened. We do not know who it was that called them;
let‟s listen to the explanation in the next chapter.
