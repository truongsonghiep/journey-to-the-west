FORTY-FOUR
The dharma-body in primal cycle meets the force of the cart
The mind, righting monstrous deviates, crosses the spine-ridge pass
The poem says:
To seek scriptures and freedom they go to the West,
An endless toil through countless mounts of fame.
The days fly by like darting hares and crows;
As petals fall and birds sing the seasons go.
A little dust—the eye reveals three thousand worlds;
The priestly staff—its head has seen four hundred isles.
They feed on wind and rest on dew to seek their goal,
Not knowing which day they may all return.
We were telling you about Tripitaka Tang and his disciples, who found the main
road to the West. Truly they had to face the wind and brave the snow, to be capped by
the moon and cloaked by the stars. They journeyed for a long time and soon it was the
time of early spring. You see
The cycled return of triple yang;
The radiance of all things.
The cycled return of triple yang
Makes all Heavens beguiling like a painted scroll;
The radiance of all things
Means flowers spread brocade through all the earth.
The plums fade to a few specks of snow;
The grains swell with the valley clouds.
Ice breaks gradually and mountain streams flow;
Seedlings sprout completely and unparched.
Truly it is that
The God of the Year rides forth;
The God of the Woods takes a drive.
Warm breezes waft floral fragrance;
Light clouds renew the light of the sun.
Willows by the wayside spread their curvate green;
The rains give life; all things bear the looks of spring.
As master and disciples traveled slowly along the road, enjoying the scenery as
they proceeded, they suddenly heard a loud cry that seemed the roar of ten thousand
voices. Tripitaka Tang was so startled that he immediately pulled in his reins and
refused to go forward. Turning back, he said, “Wukong, where did that terrible din
come from?”
“Yes, it sounded as if the earth were splitting apart and the mountains were
toppling,” said Eight Rules. “More like the crack of thunder I‟d say,” said Sha Monk.
Tripitaka said, “I still think it‟s men shouting or horses neighing.” With a chuckle,
Pilgrim Sun said, “None of you has guessed correctly. Stop here and let old Monkey go
take a look.”

Dear Pilgrim! He leaped up at once and rose into midair, treading on the cloudy
luminosity. He peered into the distance and discovered a moated city; when he looked
more carefully, he saw that it was veiled by auspicious luminosity after all and not by
any baleful vapor. “This is a nice place,” Pilgrim thought to himself. “Why should there
be such an ear-splitting roar? There are no banners or spears in sight in the city, and
what we heard couldn‟t possibly be the roar of cannons. Why is it then that we hear this
hubbub of men and horses?”
As he was thus thinking to himself, a large group of monks came into his sight:
on a sandy beach outside the city gate they were trying to pull a cart up a steep ridge. As
they strained and tugged, they cried out in unison to call on the name of the Bodhisattva
King Powerful for help, and this was the noise that startled the Tang Monk. Pilgrim
lowered his cloud gradually to take a closer look. Aha! The cart was loaded with bricks,
tiles, timber, earth clods, and the like. The ridge was exceedingly tall, and leading up to
it was a small spine-like path flanked by two perpendicular passes, with walls like two
giant cliffs. How could the cart possibly be dragged up there? Though it was such a fine
warm day that one would expect people to dress lightly, what the monks had on were
virtually rags. They looked destitute indeed! Pilgrim thought to himself, “I suppose they
must be trying to build or repair a monastery, and since a region like this undoubtedly
yields a bountiful harvest, it must be difficult for them to find part-time laborers. That‟s
why these monks themselves have to work so hard.”
As he was thus speculating, he saw two young Daoists swagger out of the city
gate.
“How were they dressed?” you ask.
Star caps crowned their heads;
Brocades draped their bodies;
Luminous star caps crowned their heads;
Colorful brocades draped their bodies.
Cloud-headed boots held up their feet;
Fine silk sashes tied up their waists.
Like full moons their faces were handsome and bright;
They had the fair forms of jade- Heaven gods.
When the monks saw the two Daoists, they were terrified; every one of them
redoubled his effort to pull desperately at the cart. “So, that‟s it!” said Pilgrim,
comprehending the situation all at once. “These monks must be awfully afraid of the
Daoists, for if not, why should they be tugging so hard at the carts? I have heard
someone say that there is a place on the road to the West where Daoism is revered and
Buddhism is set for destruction. This must be the place. I would like to go back and
report this to Master, but I still don‟t know the whole truth and he might blame me for
bringing him surmises, saying that even a smart person like me can‟t be counted on for
a reliable report. Let me go down there and question them thoroughly before I give
Master an answer.”
“Whom would he question?” you ask. Dear Great Sage! He lowered his cloud
and with a shake of his torso, he changed at the foot of the city into a mendicant Daoist
of the Complete Truth order, with an exorcist hamper hung on his left arm. Striking a
hollow wooden fish with his hands and chanting lyrics of Daoist themes, he walked up
to the two Daoists near the city gate. “Masters,” he said, bowing, “this humble Daoist
572
572
raises his hand.” Returning his salute, one of the Daoists said, “Sir, where did you come
from?”
“This disciple,” said Pilgrim, “has wandered to the corners of the sea and to the
edges of Heaven. I arrived here this morning with the sole purpose of collecting
subscriptions for good works. May I ask the two masters which street in this city is
favorable toward the Dao, and which alley is inclined toward piety? This humble Daoist
would like to go there and beg for some vegetarian food.” Smiling, the Daoist said, “O
Sir! Why do you speak in such a disgraceful manner?”
“What do you mean by disgraceful?” asked Pilgrim. “If you want to beg for
vegetarian food,” said the Daoist, “isn‟t that disgraceful?” Pilgrim said, “Those who
have left the family live by begging. If I didn‟t beg, where would I have money to buy
food?”
Chuckling, the Daoist said, “You‟ve come from afar, and you don‟t know
anything about our city. In this city of ours, not only the civil and military officials are
fond of the Dao, the rich merchants and men of prominence devoted to piety, but even
the ordinary citizens, young and old, will bow to present us once they see us. It is, in
fact, a trivial matter, hardly worth mentioning. What‟s most important about our city is
that His Majesty, the king, is also fond of the Dao and devoted to piety.”
“This humble cleric is first of all quite young,” said Pilgrim, “and second, he is
indeed from afar. In truth I‟m ignorant of the situation here. May I trouble the two
masters to tell me the name of this place and give me a thorough account of how the
king has come to be so devoted to the cause of Dao—for the sake of fraternal feelings
among us Daoists?”
The Daoist said, “This city has the name of the Cart Slow Kingdom, and the
ruler on the precious throne is a relative of ours.” When Pilgrim heard these words, he
broke into loud guffaws, saying, “I suppose that a Daoist has become king.”
“No,” said the Daoist. “What happened was that twenty years ago, this region
had a drought, so severe that not a single drop of rain fell from the sky and all grains
and plants perished. The king and his subjects, the rich as well as the poor—every
person was burning incense and praying to Heaven for relief. Just when it seemed that
nothing else could preserve their lives, three immortals suddenly descended from the
sky and saved us all.”
“Who were these immortals?” asked Pilgrim.
“Our masters,” said the Daoist.
“What are their names?” asked Pilgrim. The Daoist replied, “The eldest master
is called the Tiger-Strength Great Immortal; the second master, the Deer-Strength Great
Immortal; and the third master, Goat-Strength Great Immortal.”
“What kinds of magic power do your esteemed teachers possess?” asked
Pilgrim. The Daoist said, “Summoning the wind and the rain for my masters would be
as easy as flipping over one‟s palms; they point at water and it will change into oil; they
touch stones and change them into gold, as quickly as one turns over in bed. With this
kind of magic power, they are thus able to rob the creative genius of Heaven and Earth,
to alter the mysteries of the stars and constellations. The king and his subjects have such
profound respect for them that all of us Daoists are claimed as royal kin.” Pilgrim said,
“This ruler is lucky, all right. After all, the proverb says, „Magic moves ministers!‟ He
certainly can‟t lose to claim kinship with your old masters, if they possess such powers.
573
573
Alas! I wonder if I had even the tiniest spark of affinity, such that I could have an
audience with the old masters.”
Chuckling, the Daoist replied, “If you want to see our masters, it‟s not difficult
at all. The two of us are their bosom disciples. Moreover, our masters are so devoted to
the Way and so deferential to the pious that the mere mention of the word „Dao‟ would
bring them out of the door, full of welcome. If we two were to introduce you, we would
need to exert ourselves no more vigorously than to blow away some ashes.”
Bowing deeply, Pilgrim said, “I am indebted to you for your introduction. Let us
go into the city then.”
“Let‟s wait a moment,” said one of the Daoists. “You sit here while we two
finish our official business first. Then we‟ll go with you.” Pilgrim said, “Those of us
who have left the family are without cares or ties; we are completely free. What do you
mean by official business?”
The Daoist pointed with his finger at the monks on the beach and said, “Their
work happens to be the means of livelihood for us. Lest they become indolent, we have
come to check them off the roll before we go with you.” Smiling, Pilgrim said, “You
must be mistaken, Masters.
Buddhists and Daoists are all people who have left the family. For what reason
are they working for our support? Why are they willing to submit to our roll call?”
The Daoist said, “You have no idea that in the year when we were all praying
for rain, the monks bowed to Buddha on one side while the Daoists petitioned the Pole
Star on the other, all for the sake of finding some food for the country. The monks,
however, were useless, their empty chants of sūtras wholly without efficacy. As soon as
our masters arrived on the scene, they summoned the wind and the rain and the bitter
affliction was removed from the multitudes. It was then that the court became terribly
vexed at the monks, saying that they were completely ineffective and that they deserved
to have their monasteries wrecked and their Buddha images destroyed. Their travel
rescripts were revoked and they were not permitted to return to their native regions. His
Majesty gave them to us instead and they were to serve as bondsmen: they are the ones
who tend the fires in our Abbey, who sweep the grounds, and who guard the gates.
Since we have some buildings in the rear that are not completely finished, we have
ordered these monks here to haul bricks, tiles, and timber for the construction. But for
fear of their mischief, indolence, and unwillingness to pull the cart, we have come to
investigate and make the roll call.” When Pilgrim heard that, he tugged at the Daoists as
tears rolled from his eyes. “I said that I might not have the good affinity to see your old
masters,” he said, “and true enough I don‟t.”
“Why not?” asked the Daoist.
“This humble Daoist is making a wide tour of the world,” said Pilgrim, “both for
the sake of eking out a living and for finding a relative.”
“What sort of relative do you have?” asked the Daoist. Pilgrim said, “I have an
uncle, who since his youth had left the family and shorn his hair to become a monk.
Because of famine some years ago he had to go abroad to beg for alms and hadn‟t
returned since.
As I remembered our ancestral benevolence, I decided that I would make a
special effort to find him along the way. It‟s very likely, I suppose, that he is detained
574
574
here and cannot go home. I must find him somehow and get to see him before I can go
inside the city with you.”
“That‟s easy,” said the Daoist. “The two of us can sit here while you go down to
the beach to make the roll call for us. There should be five hundred of them on the roll.
Take a look and see if your uncle is among them. If he is, we‟ll let him go for the sake
of the fact that you, too, are a fellow Daoist. Then we‟ll go inside the city with you.
How about that?” Pilgrim thanked them profusely, and with a deep bow he took leave of
the Daoists. Striking up his wooden fish, he headed down to the beach, passing the
double passes as he walked down the narrow path from the steep ridge. All those monks
knelt down at once and kowtowed, saying in unison, “Father, we have not been
indolent. Not even half a person from the five hundred is missing—we are all here
pulling the cart.” Snickering to himself, Pilgrim thought, “These monks must have been
awfully abused by the Daoist. They are terrified even when they see a fake Daoist like
me. If a real Daoist goes near them, they will probably die of fear.” Waving his hand,
Pilgrim said, “Get up, and don‟t be afraid! I‟m not here to inspect your work, I‟m here
to find a relative.” When those monks heard that he was looking for a relative, they
surrounded him on all sides, every one of them sticking out his head and coughing,
hoping that he would be claimed as kin. “Which of us is his relative?” they asked. After
he had looked at them for awhile, Pilgrim burst into laughter.
“Father,” said the monks, “you don‟t seem to have found your relative. Why are
you laughing instead?” Pilgrim said, “You want to know why I‟m laughing? I‟m
laughing at how immature you monks are! It was because of your having been born
under an unlucky star that your parents, for fear of your bringing misfortune upon them
or for not bringing with you additional brothers and sisters, turned you out of the family
and made you priests. How could you then not follow the Three Jewels and not revere
the law of Buddha? Why aren‟t you reading the sūtras and chanting the litanies? Why
do you serve the Daoists and allow them to exploit you as bondsmen and slaves?”
“Venerable Father,” said the monks, “are you here to ridicule us? You must have
come from abroad, and you have no idea of our plight.”
“Indeed I‟m from abroad,” said Pilgrim, “and I truly have no idea of what sort of
plight you have.”
As they began to weep, the monks said, “The ruler of our country is wicked and
partial. All he cares for are those persons like you, Venerable Father, and those whom
he hates are us Buddhists.”
“Why is that?” asked Pilgrim. “Because the need for wind and rain,” said one of
the monks, “caused three immortal elders to come here. They deceived our ruler and
persuaded him to tear down our monasteries and revoke our travel rescripts, forbidding
us to return to our native regions. He would not, moreover, permit us to serve even in
any secular capacity except as slaves in the household of those immortal elders. Our
agony is unbearable! If any Daoist mendicant shows up in this region, they would
immediately request the king to grant him an audience and a handsome reward; but if a
monk appears, regardless of whether he is from nearby or afar, he will be seized and
sent to be a servant in the house of the immortals.” Pilgrim said, “Could it be that those
Daoists are truly in possession of some mighty magic, potent enough to seduce the
king? If it‟s only a matter of summoning the wind and the rain, then it is merely a trivial
trick of heterodoxy. How could it sway a ruler‟s heart?”
575
575
The monks said, “They know how to manipulate cinnabar and refine lead, to sit
in meditation in order to nourish their spirits. They point to water and it changes into
oil; they touch stones and transform them into pieces of gold. Now they are in the
process of building a huge abbey for the Three Pure Ones, in which they can perform
rites to Heaven and Earth and read scriptures night and day, to the end that the king will
remain youthful for ten thousand years. Such enterprise undoubtedly pleases the king.”
“So that‟s how it is!” said Pilgrim. “Why don‟t you all run away and be done
with it?”
“Father, we can‟t!” said the monks. “Those immortal elders have obtained
permission from the king to have our portraits painted and hung up in all four quarters
of the kingdom.
Although the territory of this Cart Slow Kingdom is quite large, there is a picture
of monks displayed in the marketplace of every village, town, county, and province. It
bears on top the royal inscription that any official who catches a monk will be elevated
three grades, and any private citizen who does so will receive a reward of fifty taels of
white silver. That‟s why we can never escape. Let‟s not say monks—but even those
who have cut their hair short or are getting bald will find it difficult to get past the
officials. They are everywhere, the detectives and the runners! No matter what you do,
you simply can‟t flee. We have no alternative but to remain here and suffer.”
“In that case,” said Pilgrim, “you might as well give up and die.”
“Venerable Father,” said the monks, “many of us have died. There were
altogether some two thousand monks caught and brought here: some six or seven
hundred of them have perished because they could not bear the suffering and the
persecution, or because they could not endure the cold or adjust to the climate. Another
seven or eight hundred committed suicide. Only we five hundred failed to die.”
“What do you mean by that?” asked Pilgrim. The monks said, “When we tried to
hang ourselves, the ropes snapped; when we tried to cut ourselves, the blades were
blunt; when we hurled ourselves into the river, we floated back up instead; and when we
took poison, nothing happened to us.” Pilgrim said, “You are very lucky! Heaven must
be desirous of prolonging your lives!”
“The last word is not quite right, Venerable Father,” said the monks, “for surely
you mean prolonging our torments! Our daily meals are thin gruel made of the coarsest
grains, and at night, we have nowhere to rest but this exposed piece of sandy beach.
When we close our eyes, however, there will be deities here to protect us.”
“You mean the hard work during the day,” said Pilgrim, “causes you to see
ghosts at night.”
“Not ghosts,” said the monks, “but the Six Gods of Darkness and the Six Gods
of Light, together with the Guardians of Monasteries. When night falls, they will appear
to protect us and, in fact, prevent those who want to die from dying.” Pilgrim said,
“These gods are rather unreasonable. They should rather let you die early so that you
could reach Heaven at once. Why are they guarding you like that?”
The monks said, “They try to comfort us in our dreams, telling us not to seek
death but to endure our suffering for awhile until the arrival of the holy monk from the
Great Tang in the Land of the East, the arhat who is journeying to the Western Heaven
to acquire scriptures. Under him, we are told, there is a disciple who is the Great Sage,
Equal to Heaven, and who has vast magic powers. He is, moreover, a person of
576
576
rectitude and kindness, one who will avenge the injustices of the world, assist those who
are needy and oppressed, and comfort the orphans and the widows. We are told to wait
for his arrival, for he will reveal his power and destroy the Daoists, so that the teaching
of Chan and complete poverty will be honored once more.” When Pilgrim heard these
words, he said silently to himself, smiling,
“Don‟t say old Monkey has no competence,
For gods proclaim early his eminence.”
Turning quickly and striking up again the wooden fish, he left the monks to
return to the city gate to meet the Daoists. “Sir,” said the Daoists as they greeted him,
“which of them is your relative?”
“All five hundred of them are relatives of mine,” said Pilgrim.
Laughing, the two Daoists said, “How could you have that many relatives?”
“One hundred are neighbors to my left,” said Pilgrim, “and one hundred are
neighbors to my right; one hundred belong to my father‟s side, and one hundred belong
to my mother‟s side.
Finally, one hundred happen to be my bond-brothers. If you are willing to let
these five hundred persons go, I‟ll be willing to enter the city with you. If you are not, I
won‟t go with you.”
The Daoists said, “You must be a little crazy, for all at once you are babbling!
These monks happen to be gifts from the king. If we want to release even one or two of
them, we will have to go first before our masters to report that they are ill. Then, we
have to submit a death certificate before we can consider the matter closed. How could
you ask us to release them all? Nonsense! Nonsense! Why, not to speak of the fact that
we would be left without servants in our household, but even the court might be
offended. The king might send some officials to look into the work here or he himself
might come to investigate. How could we dare let them go?”
“You won‟t release them?” said Pilgrim. “No, we won‟t!” said the Daoists.
Pilgrim asked them three times and his anger flared up. Whipping out his iron rod from
his ear, he squeezed it once in the wind and it had the thickness of a rice bowl. He tested
it with his hand before slamming it down on the Daoists‟ heads. How pitiful! This one
blow made
Their heads crack, their blood squirts, their bodies sink low;
Their skin split, their necks snap, their brains outflow!
Those monks on the beach, when they saw in the distance that he had slain the
Daoists, all abandoned the cart and ran toward him, crying, “What disaster! You‟ve just
killed royal kin.”
“What royal kin?” asked Pilgrim. The monks had him completely surrounded,
crying, “Their masters would not bow to the king when they walk into court, and when
they walk out, they need not take leave of the lord. His Majesty addresses them
constantly as Messrs. Preceptors of State, Elder Brothers. How could you come here and
cause such a terrible disaster? Their disciples came out to this place to supervise our
work and they did not offend you. How could you beat them to death? If those immortal
elders claimed that you were here only to supervise our labor and that we were the ones
who took their lives, what would happen to us? We must go into the city with you and
have you confess your guilt first.”
577
577
“Stop hollering, all of you,” said Pilgrim, laughing. “I am no mendicant Daoist
of the Complete Truth order. I‟m here to save you.”
“You have murdered two men,” said the monks, “and we are likely to be blamed
for it. Look what you have added to our burdens! How could you be our savior?”
Pilgrim said, “I am Pilgrim Sun Wukong, the disciple of the holy monk of the Great
Tang. I have come especially to save your lives.”
“No! No!” cried the monks. “You can‟t be, for we can recognize that venerable
father.”
“You haven‟t even met him,” said Pilgrim, “so how could you recognize him?”
The monks said, “We have met in our dreams an old man who identified himself
as the Gold Star Venus. He told us over and over again how Pilgrim Sun was supposed
to look so that we wouldn‟t make a mistake in identifying him.”
“What did he tell you?” asked Pilgrim. The monks said, “He said that the Great
Sage has
A bumpy brow, and golden eyes flashing;
A round head and a hairy face jowl-less;
Gaping teeth, pointed mouth, a character most sly;
He looks more strange than thunder god.
Using a golden-hooped iron rod,
He once broke Heaven‟s gates apart.
He now follows Truth, protecting a monk,
And saves humankind from distress.”
When Pilgrim heard these words, he was both pleased and annoyed; pleased,
because the gods had spread wide his fame, but also annoyed, because those old rogues,
he thought, had revealed to mortals his primal form. He blurted out all at once, “Indeed
all of you can see that I am not Pilgrim Sun, but I am a disciple of his, just learning how
to cause some trouble for fun! Look over there! Isn‟t that Pilgrim Sun who is
approaching?”
He pointed to the East with his finger and tricked the monks into turning their
heads. As they did so, he revealed his true form, which the monks recognized
immediately. Every one of them went to his knees, saying, “Father, we are of fleshly
eyes and mortal stock, and we failed to know that you appeared to us in transformation.
We beg Father to avenge our wrongs and dispel our woes by entering the city quickly
and exterminating the demonic ones.”
“Follow me,” said Pilgrim, and the monks all followed him closely.
The Great Sage walked to the beach. Exerting his magic power, he yanked the
cart through the two passes and up the spine ridge before picking it up and smashing it
to pieces. He then tossed all those bricks, tiles, and timber down a ravine. “Go away!”
he bellowed to the monks. “Don‟t crowd around me. Let me see the king tomorrow and
destroy those Daoists.”
“O Father!” said those monks. “We dare not go very far away, for we fear that
we might be caught by the officials. Then we would be brought back for beatings and
for ransom, and there would be no end to our woes.”
“In that case,” said Pilgrim, “let me give you some means of protection.”
578
578
Dear Great Sage! He plucked a handful of hairs that he chewed into small
pieces. To each of the monks he gave a piece with the instruction:
“Stick it into the nail of your fourth finger and then make a fist. You can walk as
far as you want. Don‟t do anything if no one comes to seize you, but if there should be
someone trying to arrest you, hold your fist up tightly and cry, „Great Sage, Equal to
Heaven.‟ I will come at once to protect you.”
“Father,” said the monks, “if we walk too far away and you can‟t see or hear us,
what good will it do?”
“Relax,” said Pilgrim, “for even if you are ten thousand miles away, I guarantee
that nothing will happen to you.” One of the monks who was somewhat courageous
indeed held up his fist and whispered, “Great Sage, Equal to Heaven.”
At once a thunder spirit stood in front of him, holding an iron rod. He looked so
formidable that not even a thousand cavalry would dare charge near him. Several scores
of the monks made the call also, and several scores of Great Sages at once appeared.
The monks kowtowed, crying, “Father, truly an efficacious manifestation!”
“When you want it to disappear,” said Pilgrim, “all you have to say is the word,
„Cease.‟”
They cried, “Cease!” and the hairs appeared again in their nails. The monks
were overjoyed and began to disperse. “Don‟t go too far away,” said Pilgrim, “but listen
for news of me in the city. If a proclamation requesting for monks to return to the city is
published, you may then enter the city and give me back my hairs.”
Those five hundred monks then scattered in all directions, and we shall speak no
more of them for the moment.
We tell you now instead about the Tang Monk by the wayside. While he waited
in vain for Pilgrim to come back with a report, he told Zhu Eight Rules to lead the horse
forward toward the West. As they proceeded, they met some monks hurrying by, and
when they drew near the city, they saw Pilgrim standing there with a dozen or so monks
who had not dispersed. Reining in his horse, Tripitaka said, “Wukong, you were sent
here to find out about the strange noise. Why did it take you so long and still you didn‟t
return?” Leading those monks to bow before the Tang Monk‟s horse, Pilgrim gave a
thorough account of what had happened. Horrified, Tripitaka said, “If this is the
situation, what shall we do?”
“Please have no fear, Venerable Father,” said those monks. “Father Great Sage
Sun is an incarnation of a Heavenly god, and his vast magic powers will no doubt
prevent you from coming to any harm. We are priests of the Wisdom Depth Monastery
of this city, an edifice built by imperial command of the late king, the father of the
present ruler. Since the image of the late king is still inside the monastery, it has not
been torn down along with all the other monasteries, big and small, of the city. Let us
invite the venerable father to go into the city and rest in our humble dwelling. We are
certain that the Great Sage Sun will know what to do by the time of the morning court
tomorrow.”
“What you say is quite right,” said Pilgrim. “All right! We might as well enter
the city first.”
The elder dismounted and went up to the city gate. The sun was setting as they
walked across the drawbridge and inside the triple gates. When people on the streets
579
579
saw that priests from the Wisdom Depth Monastery were toting luggage and leading a
horse, they all drew back and avoided them. Before long they reached the entrance of
the monastery, where they saw hanging high above the gate a huge plaque on which was
written in gold letters:
“The Wisdom Depth Monastery, Built by Imperial Command.” Pushing open
the gates, the monks led them through the Vairocana Hall. They then opened the door to
the main hall; the Tang Monk draped the cassock over his body and prostrated himself
before the golden image. Only after he had paid homage to Buddha in this manner did
he walk inside the main hall. “Hey, you who are looking after the house!” cried the
monks, and an old priest emerged. When he saw Pilgrim, he fell on his knees at once
and cried, “Father, have you arrived?”
“Who am I?” asked Pilgrim. “Why should you address me and honor me in this
manner?”
“I recognize you to be the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven, the Father Sun,” said
the priest. “Every night we dream of you, for the Gold Star Venus frequently appears to
us in our dreams, telling us that we can preserve our lives only when you come to us.
Today, I can tell immediately that you are the one whom we saw in our dreams. O
Father, I‟m so glad that you have arrived in time.
After one or two more days, we may all become ghosts!”
“Please rise! Please rise!” said Pilgrim with laughter. “Tomorrow you will see
some results!”
The monks all went to prepare for them a vegetarian meal, after which they
swept clean the abbot‟s residence for the pilgrims to rest.
Pilgrim, however, was so preoccupied that he could not sleep even by the time
of the second watch. From somewhere nearby also came the sound of pipes and gongs,
and he became so aroused that he rose quietly and slipped on his clothes. He leaped into
midair to have a better look and at once discovered that there was the bright glare of
lamps and torches due south of him. Lowering his cloud, he peered intently and found
that the Daoists of the Three Pure Ones Abbey were making supplications to the stars.
He saw
The spiritual realm of a tall chamber;
The blessed place of a magic hall.
The spiritual realm of a tall chamber,
August like the features of Mount Penglai;
The blessed place of a magic hall,
Immaculate like the Palace of Transformed Joy.
Daoists on both sides played their strings and pipes;
Masters at the center held up their tablets of jade.
They expounded the Woe-Dispelling Litany;
They lectured on the Classic of the Way and Virtue.
To raise dust a few times they wrote out their charms;
To make the supplication they prostrated themselves.
With spell and water they sent a dispatch
As flames of torches shot up to the Region Above.
They sought and questioned the stars
As fragrant incense rose through the azure sky.
580
580
Before the stands were fresh offerings;
On top of tables were victuals sumptuous.
On both sides of the hall‟s entrance was hung a pair of yellow silk scrolls on
which the following parallel couplet in large characters was embroidered:
For wind and rain in due season,
We invoke the Celestial Worthies‟ boundless power.
As the empire‟s peaceful and prosperous,
May our lord‟s reign exceed ten thousand years.
There were three old Daoists resplendent in their ritual robes, and Pilgrim
thought they had to be the Tiger-Strength, Deer-Strength, and Goat-Strength Immortals.
Below them there was a motley crew of some seven or eight hundred Daoists; lined up
on opposite sides, they were beating drums and gongs, offering incense, and saying
prayers. Secretly pleased, Pilgrim said to himself, “I would like to go down there and
fool with them a bit, but as the proverb says,
A silk fiber is no thread;
A single hand cannot clap.
Let me go back and alert Eight Rules and Sha Monk. Then we can return and
have some fun.” Putting his auspicious cloud on a descending path, he headed straight
back to the abbot‟s hall, where he found Eight Rules and Sha Monk asleep head to foot
in one bed. Pilgrim tried to wake Wujing first, and as he stirred, Sha Monk said, “Elder
Brother, you aren‟t asleep yet?”
“Get up now,” said Pilgrim, “for you and I are going to enjoy ourselves.”
“In the dead of night,” said Sha Monk, “how could we enjoy ourselves when our
mouths are dried and our eyes won‟t stay open?” Pilgrim said, “There is indeed in this
city an Abbey of the Three Pure Ones. Right now the Daoists in the Abbey are
conducting a mass, and their main hall is filled with all kinds of offerings. The buns are
big as barrels, and their cakes must weigh fifty or sixty pounds each. There are also
countless rice condiments and fresh fruits. Come with me and we‟ll go enjoy
ourselves!” When Zhu Eight Rules heard in his sleep that there were nice edibles, he
immediately woke up, saying, “Elder Brother, aren‟t you going to take care of me, too?”
“Brother,” said Pilgrim, “if you want to eat, don‟t make all these noises and
wake up Master. Just follow me.”
The two of them slipped on their clothes and walked quietly out the door. They
trod on the cloud with Pilgrim and rose into the air.
When Idiot saw the flare of lights, he wanted immediately to go down there had
not Pilgrim pulled him back. “Don‟t be so impatient,” said Pilgrim. “Wait till they
disperse. Then we can go down there.”
Eight Rules said, “But obviously they are having such a good time praying. Why
would they want to disperse?”
“Let me use a little magic,” said Pilgrim, “and they will.”
Dear Great Sage! He made the magic sign with his fingers and recited a spell
before he drew in his breath facing the ground toward the southwest. Then he blew it
out and at once a violent whirlwind assailed the Three Pure Ones Hall, smashing flower
vases and candle stands and tearing up all the ex-votos hanging on the four walls. As
lights and torches were all blown out, the Daoists became terrified. Tiger-Strength
581

Immortal said, “Disciples, let‟s disperse. Since this divine wind has extinguished all our
lamps, torches, and incense, each of us should retire. We can rise earlier tomorrow
morning to recite a few more scrolls of scriptures and make up for what we miss
tonight.”
The various Daoists indeed retired.
Our Pilgrim, leading Eight Rules and Sha Monk, lowered their clouds and
dashed up to the Three Pure Ones Hall. Without bothering to find out whether it was
raw or cooked, Idiot grabbed one of the cakes and gave it a fierce bite. Pilgrim whipped
out the iron rod and tried to give his hand a whack. Hastily withdrawing his hand to
dodge the blow, Eight Rules said, “I haven‟t even found out the taste yet, and you‟re
trying to hit me already?”
“Don‟t be so rude,” said Pilgrim. “Let‟s sit down with proper manners and then
we may treat ourselves.”
“Aren‟t you embarrassed?” asked Eight Rules. “You are stealing food, you
know, and you still want proper manners! If you were invited here, what would you do
then?” Pilgrim said, “Who are these bodhisattvas sitting up there?”
“What do you mean by who are these bodhisattvas?” chuckled Eight Rules.
“Can‟t you recognize the Three Pure Ones?”
“Which Three Pure Ones?” asked Pilgrim. “The one in the middle,” said Eight
Rules, “is the Celestial Worthy of Commencement; the one on the left is the Daoist
Lord of Numinous Treasures; and the one on the right is the Most High Aged Lord,
Laozi.” Pilgrim said, “We have to take on their appearances. Only then can we eat
safely and comfortably.” When he caught hold of the delicious fragrance coming from
the offerings, Idiot could wait no longer. Climbing up onto the tall platform, he gave the
figure of Laozi a shove with his snout and pushed it to the floor, saying, “Old fellow,
you have sat here long enough! Now let old Hog take your place for awhile!” So Eight
Rules changed himself into Laozi, while Pilgrim took on the appearance of the Celestial
Worthy of Commencement and Sha Monk became the Daoist Lord of Numinous
Treasures. All the original images were pushed down to the floor. The moment they sat
down, Eight Rules began to gorge himself with the huge buns. “Could you wait one
moment?” said Pilgrim. “Elder Brother,” said Eight Rules, “we have changed into their
forms. Why wait any longer?”
“Brother,” said Pilgrim, “it‟s a small thing to eat, but giving ourselves away is
no small matter! These holy images we pushed on the floor could be found by those
Daoists who had to rise early to strike the bell or sweep the grounds. If they stumbled
over them, wouldn‟t our secret be revealed? Why don‟t you see if you can hide them
somewhere?”
Eight Rules said, “This is an unfamiliar place, and I don‟t even know where to
begin to look for a hiding spot.”
“Just now when we entered the hall,” Pilgrim said, “I chanced to notice a little
door on our right. Judging from the foul stench coming through it, I think it must be a
Bureau of Five-Grain Transmigration. Send them in there.” Idiot, in truth, was rather
good at crude labor! He leaped down, threw the three images over his shoulder, and
carried them out of the hall. When he kicked open the door, he found a huge privy
inside. Chuckling to himself he said, “This Ban-Horse-Plague truly has a way with
words! He even bestows on a privy a sacred title! The Bureau of Five-Grain
582
582
Transmigration, what a name!” Still hauling the images on his shoulders, Idiot began to
mumble this prayer to them:
“O Pure Ones Three,
I‟ll confide in thee:
From afar we came,
Staunch foes of bogies.
We‟d like a treat,
But nowhere‟s cozy.
We borrow your seats
For awhile only.
You‟ve sat too long,
Now join the privy.
In times past you‟ve enjoyed countless good things
By being pure and clean Daoists.
Today you can‟t avoid facing something dirty
When you become Celestial Worthies Most Smelly!”
After he had made his supplication, he threw them inside with a splash and half
of his robe was soiled by the muck. As he walked back into the hall, Pilgrim said, “Did
you hide them well?”
“Well enough,” said Eight Rules, “but some of the filth stained my robe. It still
stinks. I hope it won‟t make you retch.”
“Never mind,” said Pilgrim, laughing, “you just come and enjoy yourself. I
wonder if we could all make a clean getaway!”
After Idiot changed back into the form of Laozi, the three of them took their
seats and abandoned themselves to enjoyment. They ate the huge buns fist; then they
gobbled down the side dishes, the rice condiments, the dumplings, the baked goods, the
cakes, the deep-fried dishes, and the steamed pastries—regardless of whether these were
hot or cold. Pilgrim Sun, however, was not too fond of anything cooked; all he had were
a few pieces of fruit, just to keep the other two company. Meanwhile Eight Rules and
Sha Monk went after the offerings like comets chasing the moon, like wind mopping up
the clouds! In no time at all, the food was completely devoured. When there was
nothing left for them to eat, instead of leaving, they remained seated there to chat and
wait for the food to digest.
Alas! This was what had to happen! There was, you see, in the east corridor a
young Daoist, who, just when he had lain down, scrambled up again all at once when he
thought to himself, “I left my handbell in the hall. If I lost it, the masters would rebuke
me tomorrow.”
He said to his companion, “You sleep first. I‟ve got to go find something.”
Without even putting on his undergarments, he threw a shirt on himself and went to the
main hall to search for his bell. Groping this way and that in the darkness, he finally
found it.
As he was turning to leave, he suddenly heard sounds of breathing. Terribly
frightened, the Daoist began to rush out of the hall, and as he did so, he stepped on a
lychee seed, which sent him crashing to the floor and the bell was smashed to pieces.
Unable to restrain himself, Zhu Eight Rules burst into roars of laughter, frightening the
583
583
little Daoist out of his wits. He scrambled up only to fall down once more; stumbling all
over, he managed to reach the master residence.
“Grand-Masters,” he screamed as he pounded on the door, “It‟s terrible!
Disaster!”
The three old Daoists had not yet fallen asleep.
They opened the door to ask, “What disaster?”
Trembling all over, the young Daoist said, “Your disciple left behind his
handbell, and he went to the main hall to search for it. I heard someone roaring with
laughter, and it almost frightened me to death.” When the old Daoists heard these
words, they cried, “Bring some light. Let‟s see what kind of perverse creature is
around.”
The Daoists sleeping along the two corridors, old and young, were all aroused,
and they at once scrambled up to the main hall with lamps and torches. We do not know
what was the result; let‟s listen to the explanation in the next chapter.
