FIFTY
Nature follows confused feelings through lust and desire
Faint spirit and moved mind meet a demon chief
The poem says:
Sweep often the grounds of the mind;
Wipe clean the dust of affections.
Let not the pit ensnare your Buddha-self.
Only when essential self‟s clean
May you your primal source convene.
You must lift and trim nature‟s wick
To breathe thus freely at Caoxi.
Keep the horse and the ape from sounding harsh:
Through night and day a breath serene
Will let all your technique be seen.
The tune of this lyric poem is called A Southern Branch. It is meant to describe
the Tang Monk and how he escaped from his ordeal of ice in the Heaven-Reaching
River and how he ascended the other shore by standing on the white turtle. Master and
the disciples, the four of them, followed the main road and set out again toward the
West. It was the time of midwinter, and they saw
Faint outlines of woodlands in the mists,
Clear frames of bare mountains in the stream.
As master and disciples walked along, they again came upon a huge mountain
blocking their way. The road turned exceedingly narrow and the cliffs were tall;
moreover, there were many rocks and the ridges were so steep that it would be difficult
for humans or horses to proceed. Reining in his horse, Tripitaka called out, “Disciples.”
Pilgrim led Zhu Eight Rules and Sha Monk forward, saying, “Master, what do you have
to say?”
“Look how tall the mountain is ahead of us,” said Tripitaka. “I fear that tigers
and wolves might run rampant up there, or strange beasts might come out to attack us.
Be careful!”
“Please do not worry, Master,” said Pilgrim. “We three brothers are united in a
single effort to embrace the Right and seek the Real. We will exercise our power to
disperse monsters and subdue fiends. You needn‟t be afraid of any tigers or wolves!”
On hearing his words, Tripitaka felt more assured and urged his horse forward to ascend
the cliff. As they did so, they glanced around and saw that it was quite a mountain
indeed.
Rugged and soaring—
Pointed and towering—
Rugged and soaring it rises to the sky;
Pointed and towering it blocks the blue heavens.
Strange rocks piled high like tigers sitting;
Hoary pines aslant like dragons flying.
Atop the peak a bird sings a pretty song;
Before the cliff the plums waft a strong, sweet scent.
653
653
The brook swells and surges, its water cold;
The clouds assail the summit, dense and dark.
You also feel the drifting snow,
The biting wind,
And the mountain‟s roaring, famished tiger.
Jackdaws pick through the trees but find no nest;
Wild deer search in vain for a place to rest.
Pity the travelers, who can hardly walk:
Crestfallen, downcast, they cover their heads!
Master and disciples, the four of them, braved the snow and cold to scale,
shivering, the rugged peak. After they passed it, they saw in the distance a towered
building in the fold of the mountain and some charming buildings nearby. Delighted,
the Tang Monk said on his horse, “O Disciples, I feel so cold and hungry today! It‟s a
good thing that there are in the fold of the mountain that building and the houses. It has
to be either a village, a mansion, an abbey, or a monastery. Let‟s go and beg for some
food. We can move on after we have a meal.” When Pilgrim heard this, he opened wide
his eyes to look and saw that the place was shrouded with baleful clouds and diabolical
air. “Master,” he turned to speak to the Tang Monk, “that‟s not a good place.”
“There are buildings and houses,” said Tripitaka. “Why isn‟t it a good place?”
“O Master,” said Pilgrim with a snicker, “how could you know? There are
plenty of monsters and demons on the way to the West, and they are most capable of
devising some form of houses or dwellings. It doesn‟t matter whether it is a towered
building or a pavilion, or some such edifice; any one of these can be merely a
transformation to deceive people.
You have heard of the saying that „a dragon can beget nine kinds of offspring.‟
One of them is the giant clam; the breath this creature emits is luminous and takes on
the appearance of buildings and houses. When a big river is caught in inclement
weather, that‟s when the giant clam produces such a mirage. If some birds or crows
happen to fly by and decide to rest their wings on these specious buildings, the clam
will swallow them with one gulp. It‟s a vicious trap. When I see how baleful the aura is
over there, I must tell you not to approach it.”
“So we can‟t go over there,” said Tripitaka, “but I‟m really hungry!”
“If you are, Master, please dismount,” said Pilgrim. “Sit here on level ground
and let me go somewhere to beg some vegetarian food for you to eat.”
Tripitaka consented and dismounted. After Eight Rules took hold of the reins,
Sha Monk put down the luggage and untied the wrap to take out the alms bowl to hand
over to Pilgrim. Taking it in his hand, Pilgrim gave this instruction to Sha Monk:
“Worthy Brother, don‟t go forward. Just stand guard over Master sitting here.
Wait until I come back with the food and we can then set out again to the West.” Sha
Monk obeyed, and Pilgrim said once more to Tripitaka, “Master, that place in front of
us betokens more evil than good. Don‟t ever leave here and go elsewhere.
Old Monkey is off to beg for food.”
“Don‟t talk anymore,” said the Tang Monk. “Just go quickly and come back. I‟ll
wait for you here.” Pilgrim turned and was about to leave, but he walked back again to
say, “Master, I realize you can‟t sit still for very long. Let me provide you with some
means of safety.”
654
654
He took out his golden-hooped rod and drew on the level ground a large circle.
The Tang Monk was asked to sit in its middle, while Eight Rules and Sha Monk stood
by either side of him. The horse and the luggage, too, were placed near them. Then
Pilgrim pressed his palms together to bow to the Tang Monk, saying, “The circle drawn
by old Monkey here is as strong as an iron wall. No matter what they are—tigers,
wolves, ogres, or demons—they will not dare come near you. But you must not step out
of the circle. Remain seated inside and no harm will come to you. But if you leave the
circle, you will in all likelihood meet with danger. Please take heed of my words! Please
take heed of my words!”
Tripitaka agreed and all three of them sat down solemnly in the circle.
Mounting the clouds, Pilgrim went south to search for a place to beg for food.
Suddenly he saw some tall, aged trees, near which was a village. He lowered his cloud
and took a careful look. He saw
Snow abusing weak willows
And ice frozen in the square pond;
Sparse bamboos waving their blue;
Dense pine trees holding their green;
A few thatched huts half decked with silver;
A small, slanted bridge powder-dusted;
Half-bloomed narcissus by the fence;
Long icicles dangling beneath the eaves.
The piercing cold wind wafted a rare scent,
But snow hid the place where plum flowers bloomed.
As Pilgrim admired the scenery of the village, he heard one of the wooden gates
open with a creak and out walked an old man, who wore a lamb‟s-wool hat, a long robe
full of holes, and a pair of grass sandals. Supporting himself with a staff, he looked up
to the sky and said, “Ah, the northwest wind is rising. It‟ll be fair tomorrow.”
Hardly had he finished speaking when a Pekingese ran out from behind him and
barked furiously at Pilgrim. Only then did the old man turn around.
Pilgrim stood before him holding the alms bowl and bowed, saying, “Old
Benefactor, this priest happens to be someone sent by imperial decree of the Great Tang
in the Land of the East to the Western Heaven to seek scriptures from Buddha. We are
passing through your region and my master is hungry. I have come to your honorable
residence to beg you for some vegetarian food.” When the old man heard this, he shook
his head and struck the ground several times with his staff, saying, “Elder, you
shouldn‟t beg for food just yet, for you have taken the wrong road.”
“I have not,” said Pilgrim. The old man said, “The main road to the Western
Heaven is due north of here, over a thousand miles away. You should go and find that
road at once.” Pilgrim laughed and said, “Yes, it is due north of here, and my master
right now is sitting beside that road and waiting for me to beg for food.”
“This monk is babbling!” said the old man. “If your master is indeed waiting at
the main road for you to beg for food, a distance of a thousand miles will require six or
seven days of traveling one way, even if you happen to be an exceptionally adroit
traveler. When you go back to him, it will take another week or so. By then, he would
be long starved to death, wouldn‟t he?” Pilgrim laughed again and said, “To tell you the
truth, Old Benefactor, I left my master not long ago, and it took me no more than the
655
655
time of drinking a cup of tea to get to this place. Once I succeed in begging some food, I
shall rush back to serve it to him for lunch.” On hearing this, the old man became
terribly frightened, thinking to himself, “This priest is a ghost! A ghost!”
He turned around and began to dash inside. Pilgrim made a grab at him and said,
“Benefactor, where are you going? If you have some food, donate it to us.”
“It‟s not convenient! It‟s not convenient!” said the old man. “Go to some other
family.”
“Benefactor,” said Pilgrim, “you aren‟t very considerate! As you said, this place
is over a thousand miles away from the main road. If I go to another family, it may take
another thousand miles. Wouldn‟t my master be really starved to death then?”
“To tell you the truth,” said the old man, “there are altogether six or seven
people in my family, and we have just washed and placed three pints of rice in the
cauldron. It‟s not even fully cooked yet. Please go somewhere else to look for your
food.” Pilgrim said, “As the ancients said, „Walking to three other houses is not like
sitting in one.‟ This humble priest will sit here and wait.” When the old man saw how
persistent Pilgrim was, he became angry; lifting his staff, he struck out at Pilgrim. Not
the least intimidated, Pilgrim allowed the old man to hit his bald head seven or eight
times without a flinch—it was as if someone were scratching an itch for him! “This is a
priest with a collision-proof head!” said the old man. “Venerable Sir,” said Pilgrim,
chuckling, “you can hit me all you want. But you‟d better remember the number of
blows you give me: one blow will cost you one pint of rice! You can take your time and
measure it!” On hearing this, the old man quickly dropped his staff and ran inside. He
slammed the door shut, yelling, “A ghost! A ghost!”
The entire household was so terrified that both the front and the back doors were
at once tightly bolted.
When Pilgrim saw that the doors were shut, he thought to himself, “This old
rogue said that they had just washed the rice and placed it in the cauldron. I wonder if
he was telling the truth. As the proverb says, „The Daoists beg from the worthies but the
Buddhists from the fools.‟ Let old Monkey go in and take a look.”
Dear Great Sage! He made the magic sign with his fingers and used the magic of
invisibility to walk straight into the kitchen: steam was indeed rising from the cauldron,
for there was inside it half a cauldron of dried rice. He stuffed the alms bowl into the
cauldron and gave it a strong scoop to fill the alms bowl with rice. He then mounted the
clouds to go back to his master, and we shall not speak of him for the moment.
We tell you now instead about the Tang Monk sitting in the circle. He waited for
a long time without seeing Pilgrim returning. Half rising, he said dejectedly, “Where did
that ape go to beg for food?”
“Who knows!” said Eight Rules on one side, snickering. “He must have gone
somewhere to play around! You think he‟s going to beg for food? He just wants us
imprisoned here!”
“What do you mean by imprisoned?” asked Tripitaka. “Don‟t you know,
Master?” said Eight Rules. “The ancients drew on the ground to establish a jail.
That‟s what he did! He drew a circle with his rod, and he claimed that it was
stronger than a wall of iron. But if some tigers or ferocious beasts really showed up,
how could this circle protect us? We might as well give ourselves to them for food!”
656
656
“Wuneng,” said Tripitaka, “what do you propose to do?”
Eight Rules said, “This place can‟t shelter us from the wind or the cold. If you
agree with old Hog, we should follow this road and start out toward the West once
more. If Elder Brother manages to get some food, he will no doubt return quickly, riding
on his cloud. He should have no difficulty catching up with us, and when there is food,
we can stop and eat first before we move on. Sitting here all this time will only make
our feet grow cold!” It was the bad luck of Tripitaka to have heard these words! He
agreed with Idiot and all of them walked out of the circle. Eight Rules led the horse
while Sha Monk poled the luggage; the elder did not even climb on the horse.
Following the road, he walked right up to the towered building and found that it was an
edifice facing south. Outside the door was a brick wall painted white with corners like
the word eight, which connected with a small towered-gate decorated with carvings of
lovebirds hung upside down and painted with five colors. The door of the building was
half closed. Eight Rules tied the horse to one of the stoneware door wedges, and Sha
Monk put down his pole. As he was sensitive to the cold wind, Tripitaka sat on the
threshold. “Master,” said Eight Rules, “this must be the residence of a noble man or an
official. If we can‟t see anyone near the front door, all the inhabitants must be inside
warming themselves by the fire. You two sit here, and let me go inside to take a look.”
“Take care!” said the Tang Monk. “Don‟t offend people!” Idiot said, “I know!
Since I was converted and entered the gate of Chan, I have acquired some manners! I‟m
not like one of those village fools!”
Tying the muckrake to his waist, Idiot straightened out his blue silk shirt and
walked inside in a civil manner. He saw three large front halls with all the curtains
drawn up; the whole place was quiet and without a trace of any human inhabitant. There
were neither furniture nor utensils. Passing the screens, he walked further inside and
came upon a long corridor, behind which was a tall, two-story building. The windows
on top were half opened, and one could see parts of a set of yellow silk curtains in the
room. “The people must be afraid of the cold,” said Idiot to himself. “They are still
sleeping!” With no regard for manners, Idiot strode right up to the second story of the
building. When he drew the curtains apart to take a look, he was so startled that he
stumbled and fell. Inside the curtains, you see, and lying on top of an ivory bed was a
skeleton of sickly white. The skull was big as a jar and the leg bones, straight as poles,
were about four or five feet long. After he had calmed down, Idiot could not restrain the
tears rolling down his cheeks. Shaking his head and sighing, he said to the skeleton, “I
wonder you are
The remains of a marshal of which nation,
Or of which domain or state a great general.
Once you were a hero striving to win;
Today how piteously you show your bones.
Your children and wife aren‟t here to serve you;
No soldiers burn incense to honor you.
You are truly most lamentable a sight:
You, who used to seek rule by might or right!”
As Eight Rules thus lamented, he suddenly saw a flare of light behind the
curtains. “Someone must be here after all to offer incense to him,” said Idiot. He went
behind the curtains hurriedly to look and found that rays of light were coming through
some screens set up in a side room. Behind the screens was a lacquered table, on which
657
657
there were several garments made of embroidered silk brocade. When Idiot picked them
up, he saw that they were three silk vests.
Without regard for good or ill, he took the vests and came down the building. He
went back through the front halls to walk out the door. “Master,” he said, “there‟s no
trace of anyone living inside. It‟s in fact a residence of the deceased. Old Hog went
inside and walked upstairs to the tall tower, where there was a skeleton inside some
yellow silk curtains. In a side room there were three silk vests, which I‟ve brought with
me. This has to be our luck, at least a little of it! Since it‟s turning cold now, we can
make good use of them. Master, take off your outer garment and put on one of those
vests. Enjoy, so you won‟t feel the cold so much.”
“No! No!” said Tripitaka. “For the Code Book says, „To take things, whether in
open or in secret, is thievery.‟ If someone found out and caught up with us, the officials
would undoubtedly charge us with the crime of theft. Take them back and put them at
the place you found them. We can sit here for awhile to escape from the wind, and when
Wukong arrives, we‟ll move on. Those of us who have left the family should not be so
covetous of small gains!”
Eight Rules said, “There‟s not a single person around, even dogs or chickens are
unaware of our presence. Only we know what we have done. Who will file charges
against me? Who will be a witness? It was as if I had picked up these vests from the
road. What do you mean by taking in open or in secret?”
“You act foolishly!” said Tripitaka. “Though man may not know it, will Heaven
be ignorant of it? Xuandi left this instruction:
He may conscience slyly despise,
But like lightning are the god‟s eyes.
Return them quickly! Don‟t be greedy for things which do not belong to you.”
Idiot, of course, refused to listen. Laughing, he said to the Tang Monk, “O Master!
Since I became a human, I have worn several vests, but none made with such lovely
brocade. If you won‟t want to put it on, let old Hog put it on. I‟m going to try something
new, and I want to warm my back a bit. When Elder Brother arrives, I‟ll take it off and
we‟ll move on.”
“If that‟s the way you put it,” said Sha Monk, “I‟ll try one, too!”
The two of them took off their shirts and put on the vests. They were just trying
to tighten the straps when all of sudden they could no longer stand up and tumbled to
the ground. The vests, you see, somehow turned out to be like two straitjackets; in an
instant, the two of them had their arms twisted backwards and firmly bound behind their
backs. Tripitaka was so taken aback that he stamped his feet and chided them; he then
went forward to try to untie them, but it was all to no avail. As the three of them made
continuous clamor over there, a demon was soon alerted.
That towered building, you see, had indeed been devised by a monster-spirit,
who had spent the days ensnaring people at the place.
As he sat in his own cave, he suddenly heard noises of complaint and
expostulation. When he hurried out to have a look, he found two victims all tied up. The
demon called up his little imps quickly and did away with the buildings and towers. The
Tang Monk was seized, along with the white horse and the luggage. Then they herded
all of them, including Eight Rules and Sha Monk, into the cave.
658
658
After the old demon took his seat high in the middle, the little fiends pushed the
Tang Monk forward and forced him to kneel down.
“Where did you come from, monk?” asked the old demon. “How dare you be so
bold as to steal my garments?”
As tears rolled down, the Tang Monk said, “This poor monk is someone sent by
the Great Tang in the Land of the East to acquire scriptures in the Western Heaven.
Stricken with hunger just now, I told my senior disciple to go to beg for food and he
hasn‟t returned.
He told us to remain seated in the mountain, and if we had listened to him, we
would not have trespassed your immortal court to find shelter from the cold wind. It was
here that these two young disciples of mine grew covetous of small things after they
found your clothes. Your poor monk certainly had no evil intentions, and they were told
to return the vests to where they were found. Refusing to listen to me, they wanted to
wear them just to warm their backs, and that was how they fell into the traps set by the
Great King. Since you have caught me, I beg you to be merciful and spare my life so
that I may proceed to acquire the true scriptures. I shall always be grateful for your
grace and kindness, which I shall forever proclaim when I return to the Land of the
East.”
“I have often heard,” said the demon, chuckling, “that if anyone eats a piece of
the Tang Monk‟s flesh, his white hair will turn black, and his fallen teeth will grow back
once more. Today it is my good fortune that you have arrived without my beckoning.
And you still expect me to spare you? What is the name of your big disciple? Where did
he go to beg for food?” On hearing the question, Eight Rules said loudly and boastfully,
“My Elder Brother is Sun Wukong, the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven, who caused great
havoc in Heaven five hundred years ago.” When the demon heard that declaration, he
became rather apprehensive. Though he did not utter a word, he thought to himself, “I
have heard for a long time that that fellow has vast magic powers. I didn‟t expect that I
would meet him by chance like this.”
Then he gave the order:
“Little ones, tie them up also with two new ropes. Put them all in the rear. Wait
until I have caught their big disciple.
Then we can steam them all together to eat them.”
The little fiends obeyed with a shout and tied up all three of them before they
were carried to the rear. The white horse was chained in the stable and the luggage was
left in the house. Then the various monster-spirits began sharpening their weapons to
prepare to catch Pilgrim, and we shall leave them for the moment.
We tell you now about Pilgrim Sun, who after he had stolen an alms bowlful of
rice from the village in the south, mounted his cloud to return to where he began. By the
time he reached the slope of the mountain and lowered his cloud, he saw that the Tang
Monk was gone. The circle he drew with his rod could be seen on the ground, but
neither the people nor the horse were anywhere in sight. He quickly turned his head to
look toward the towered buildings and found that these, too, had disappeared. All he
saw were strange rocks and mountain ridges. Aghast, Pilgrim said, “That‟s it! They
must have fallen into danger!”
Following the tracks of the horse he hurried along the road toward the West.
659
659
He journeyed for about five or six miles, and as he became more and more
dejected, he heard all at once someone speaking on the northern slope. When he looked,
he saw that it was an old man, who had on a thick woolen robe, and his head was
covered by a warm hat. On his feet he had on a pair of half-new leather boots which had
been nicely waxed. He supported himself with a staff that had a dragon head, and he
was followed by a young houseboy. The old man also carried a twig of winter-plum
blossoms in his hand, and as he walked down the slope, he was humming some kind of
song. Putting down his alms bowl, Pilgrim faced him and bowed, saying, “Old Grandpa,
this humble priest salutes you.” Returning his bow, the old man said, “Where did you
come from, elder?” Pilgrim said, “We came from the Land of the East, on our way to
seek scriptures from Buddha in the Western Heaven. Master and disciples, there were
altogether four of us. Because my master was hungry, I was sent to beg for some
vegetarian food. I told the three of them to sit on a level spot by the mountain slope
back there to wait for me. By the time I came back, however, they had disappeared. I
don‟t know which road they took. May I ask, Old Grandpa, whether you have seen
them?” When the old man heard this, he snickered and said, “Was there someone with a
long snout and huge ears among those three?”
“Yes! Yes! Yes!” said Pilgrim.
“Was there also someone with a gloomy complexion tugging a white horse and
leading a pale-faced stoutish monk?”
“Yes! Yes! Yes!” said Pilgrim. The old man said, “You have taken the wrong
road, all of you! Don‟t bother to look for them. Each of you should flee for your life!”
Pilgrim said, “The pale-faced one is my master, and those strange-looking priests are
my younger brothers. They and I were united in our determination to go to the Western
Heaven for scriptures. How could I not go to search for them?”
“I passed through this region some time ago,” said the old man, “and I saw them
taking the wrong road, which had to lead them straight into the mouth of demons.”
“Old Grandpa,” said Pilgrim, “please tell me what kind of a demon there is and
where does he live, so that I may demand their return at his door.”
The old man said, “This mountain is named the Golden Helmet Mountain, and
in it there is a Golden Helmet Cave. The master of the cave is the Great King OneHorned Buffalo, who has vast magic powers and who is most capable in the martial arts.
Your three companions this time must have lost their lives, and if you go there to search
for them, I fear that you, too, may get yourself killed.
Perhaps it‟s better for you not to go. I don‟t want to keep you from going, but I
certainly am not going to encourage you either. It‟s your decision.”
Bowing again and again to thank him, Pilgrim said, “I am grateful to the Old
Grandpa for his instructions. But I cannot possibly give up my search!”
He was about to pour out the rice that he took from the village in the south to
give to the old man so that he could put away the empty bowl when the old man lay
down his staff and took away the alms bowl. All at once the houseboy and the old man
both revealed their true forms and went to their knees to kowtow. “Great Sage,” they
cried in unison, “these humble deities dare not hide anything from you. We are the
mountain god and the local spirit of this region, and we have come to receive you here.
Let us keep the bowl and the rice for the moment, so that the Great Sage can exercise
660
660
his power. When the Tang Monk is rescued, the rice will then be presented to him and
he will appreciate what reverence and devotion the Great Sage has shown him.”
“You are asking to be beaten, clumsy ghosts!” bellowed Pilgrim. “If you knew
that I had arrived, why didn‟t you show up earlier to meet me? Why must you come in
shabby disguises?”
“The Great Sage is rather impetuous,” said the local spirit, “and this humble
deity dares not confront you directly. That‟s why we camouflage ourselves to report to
you.”
Calming down more and more, Pilgrim said, “I‟ll only make a note of your
beating this time! Take care of that alms bowl for me, and let me go and catch that
monster-spirit.”
The local spirit and the mountain god obeyed.
Tightening his sash on his tiger-skin kilt which he hitched up, our Great Sage
dashed into the mountain to look for the fiend‟s cave, holding high his golden-hooped
rod. He passed one of the cliffs and saw more strange boulders and two stone doors just
beneath a green ledge. In front of the doors were many little imps, wielding lances and
waving swords. Truly there were
Mists in auspicious folds;
Moss in bluish clumps;
Strange rugged rocks stood in array;
Rough winding paths coiled round and round.
Apes cried and birds sang in this lovely scene;
Phoenixes, male and female, danced as in Peng- Ying.
A few plums, facing the east, began to bloom;
Warmed by the sun, the bamboos displayed their green.
Beneath the steep ridge—
Within the deep brook—
Beneath the steep ridge snow piled high like powder;
Within the deep brook water froze as ice.
Pines and cedars fresh for a thousand years;
Bunches of mountain tea all glowing red.
As he did not go there merely to admire the scenery, our Great Sage strode up to
the doors and cried out in a severe voice, “Little imps! Go inside quickly and tell your
cave master that I am Sun Wukong, the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven, and the disciple
of the holy monk from the Tang court. Tell him to send out my master quickly so that
all of your lives may be spared.”
That group of fiends dashed inside to report, “Great King, there is a hairy-faced
priest with a curved beak outside. He calls himself Sun Wukong, the Great Sage, Equal
to Heaven, and he has come to demand the return of his master.” When he heard this
announcement, the demon king was delighted. “I wanted him to come!” he said. “Since
I left my former palace and descended to earth, I have never had a chance to practice
martial art. Today he is here and he will be a worthy opponent.”
He gave the order at once for his weapon to be brought out, and every one of
those fiends, young and old, in the cave aroused himself. They hurriedly hauled out a
twelve-foot-long spotted-steel lance to present to the old fiend. Then the old fiend gave
this order:
661
661
“Little ones, all of you must follow orders. Those who advance will be
rewarded; those who retreat will be executed.”
The fiends all obeyed and followed the old demon, who, when he walked out of
the cave, asked aloud, “Who is Sun Wukong?” On one side Pilgrim took a look at that
demon king and saw that he was ugly and ferocious indeed:
A jagged, single horn;
A pair of gleaming eyes;
Coarse skin swelling up from his head;
Dark flesh glowing beneath his ears.
A long tongue oft‟ licking his nose;
A wide mouth full of yellow teeth.
His hide is like indigo blue;
His tendons are tough as steel.
Rhino-like, though he can‟t light up the stream;
Steer-like, though he can‟t plow the fields.
He has no use at all for tilling the soil,
Though he has the strength to shake Heav‟n and Earth.
His two dyed-blue hands with tendons brown
Grasp firmly the long, straight, spotted-steel lance.
You‟ll see why, if you stare at his fierce form,
He‟s called Great King One- Horned Buffalo.
Pilgrim Sun walked up to him and said, “Your Grandpa Sun is here! Give me
back my master quickly, and you will suffer no harm.
Utter but half a „No,‟ and I‟ll see to it that you die faster than you can select your
burial ground!”
“You audacious, brazen monkeyspirit!” shouted the demon. “What abilities do
you have that you dare indulge in such tall talk?”
“You brazen fiend,” said Pilgrim, “it‟s only you who has never seen the abilities
of old Monkey!”
The demon said, “Your master stole some garments of mine and I caught him all
right. And now I am just about to have him steamed and eaten. What kind of a warrior
are you that you dare demand his return at my door?”
“My master is an honest and upright priest,” said Pilgrim. “It‟s impossible that
he should want to steal things from a fiend like you!”
The demon replied, “I created an immortal village beside the mountain, and your
master sneaked into one of the buildings.
What he saw he coveted, and he took three of my vests of silk brocade and put
them on. I had proof derived from both the stolen goods and witnesses, and that was
why I seized him. If you indeed are able, you should try your hand with me. If you can
withstand me for three rounds, I will spare your master‟s life. If you can‟t, I‟ll send you
to the Region of Darkness!” With a laugh, Pilgrim said, “Brazen creature! No need for
this bravado! If you speak of trying my hand, you are after old Monkey‟s own heart.
Come up here and have a taste of my rod!”
The fiendish creature, of course, was in no wise afraid of any combat. Raising
his lance, he stabbed at Pilgrim‟s face. This was quite a marvelous battle! Look at

The golden-hooped rod upraised—
The long-shaft ed lance going out—
The golden-hooped rod upraised
Is brilliant as the golden snakes of lightning.
The long-shaft ed lance going out
Is radiant like a dragon leaving the ink-dark sea.
The little imps beat the drums before the door
As they spread in formation to help the fight.
Over here our Great Sage uses his might
To reveal, back and forth, his abilities.
On that side there is a lance,
Alert and spirited;
On our side there is a rod—
Such lofty art of combat!
Truly a hero has met a hero true;
A foe has found another worthy foe.
That demon king belches purple breath like lightning coils;
This Great Sage‟s eyes flash forth rays like brocade clouds.
Because a Great Tang Monk faces an ordeal,
They, without forbearance, strive bitterly.
Closing again and again for more than thirty times, they could not reach a
decision. When that demon king saw how perfect Wukong‟s style was in using his rod,
how there was not even the slightest false move, he was so pleased that he shouted
bravos repeatedly, saying, “Marvelous ape! Marvelous ape! Truly abilities like these are
worthy to cause havoc in Heaven!”
That Great Sage, too, was also pleased by the methodical way in which the
demon king wielded his lance: as he parried left and right, every blow and every thrust
were in perfect form. “Marvelous spirit! Marvelous spirit!” cried the Great Sage also.
“Truly a demon capable of stealing elixir!”
The two of them therefore fought for twenty more rounds.
Using the tip of his lance to point at the ground, the demon king shouted for the
little imps to attack together. All those brazen fiends, wielding swords, scimitars, staffs,
and spears, rushed forward at once and surrounded the Great Sage Sun completely.
Entirely undaunted, Pilgrim only cried, “Welcome! Welcome! That‟s exactly what I
want!”
He used his golden-hooped rod to cover his front and back, to parry blows east
and west, but that gang of fiends refused to be beaten back. Growing more agitated,
Pilgrim tossed his rod up into the air, shouting, “Change!” It changed immediately into
iron rods by the hundreds and thousands; like flying snakes and soaring serpents, they
descended onto the fiends from the air. When those monster-spirits saw this, everyone
was frightened out of his wits. Covering their heads and necks, they fled toward their
cave for their lives. The old demon king, however, stood still and, laughing with scorn,
said, “Monkey, don‟t be impertinent! Watch my trick!”
He at once took out from his sleeve a white, shiny fillet and tossed it up in the
air, crying, “Hit!” With a swish, all the iron rods changed back into a single rod, which
was then sucked up by the fillet. The Great Sage Sun, completely empty-handed, had to
use his somersault desperately in order to escape with his life. Thus

The demon, in victory, returned to his cave,
But Pilgrim, in a daze, knew not what to do.
Truly it is that
The Dao is one foot but demons are ten feet tall.
Nature reels, feelings faint—the wrong home you find.
Dharma-self, alas, has no proper seat:
His act that time stems from a faulty mind!
We do not know what is the end of all this; let‟s listen to the explanation in the
next chapter.
