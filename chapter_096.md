NINETY-SIX
Squire Kou gladly receives a noble priest
The elder Tang does not covet riches
The form of forms was first formless;
The void of void, too, was not void.
Hush, noise, speech, and silence the same we deem:
Why speak of dream within a dream?
The useful is in use useless;
No power empowers power,
Like ripened fruits that redden on their own.
Ask not how they are trimm'd and grown!
We were telling you about the disciple of the Tang Monk, who used his magic
power to stop those priests from the Gold-Spreading Monastery. After the dark wind
subsided, the priests, no longer able to see the master pilgrim and his disciples, thought
that they had witnessed the descent of living buddhas. They therefore kowtowed and
returned to their own monastery, and we shall speak no more of them.
Master and disciples proceeded toward the West, and once more it was the time
of late spring and early summer.
The weather is pleasant and bright
With pond-lotus coming in sight.
Plums ripen after the rains;
Wheat in the wind its height attains.
With their young river swallows fly;
To feed their offspring pheasants cry.
The Dipper's south, the day's at its longest;
Fair and gay all things seem strongest.
Countless times they rested at night and dined at dawn, fording the streams and
climbing the slopes. On a peaceful road they journeyed for half a month, and then they
saw again a city ahead of them.
“Disciples,” asked Tripitaka, “what sort of place is this again?”
“I don't know! I don't know!” replied Pilgrim.
“You have taken this road before,” said Eight Rules, giggling. “How could you
say you don't know? There must be something uncanny about this place. You're
deliberately pretending to be ignorant just to play a trick on us.”
“This Idiot is completely unreasonable!” said Pilgrim. “Though I have traveled
several times on this road, I did it in the air. I mounted the clouds to go back and forth.
Since when did I ever make a stop on the ground? There was no reason for me to
investigate what was of no concern to me. That's why I am ignorant. There's nothing
uncanny here. Who wants to play a trick on you?”
As they talked, they came up to the edge of the city. Tripitaka dismounted to
walk over the drawbridge and enter the gate. In a corridor by a long street, two old men
1258
1258
were seated and conversing. “Disciples,” said Tripitaka, “stand out in the middle of the
road.
Lower your heads and behave yourselves. Let me go up to the corridor to ask
what place this is.” Pilgrim and the rest indeed obeyed him and stood still.
The elder drew near, pressed his palms together, and called out, “Old patrons,
this humble cleric salutes you.”
Those two old men were just having a leisurely discussion—about the rise and
fall, the gains and losses of past dynasties, about who were the sages and worthies, and
about the great, lamentable fact that what had once been a heroic enterprise was now
reduced to nothing—when they suddenly heard this salutation. They at once returned
the greeting and said, “What does the elder wish to say?”
“This humble cleric came from afar to worship Buddha,” said Tripitaka.
“Having just reached your treasure region, I do not know its name. I would like to know
also where I might find a family inclined to charity, so that I might beg a meal there.”
One of the old men said, “This is the Bronze Estrade Prefecture, behind which is the
Numinous Earth District. If the elder wishes to have vegetarian meal, there is no need
for you to beg. Go past this archway, and on the street running north and south, you'll
come to a towered-gate facing east guarded by figures of sitting tigers. This is the home
of Squire Kou; before his door there's also a plaque with the inscription, Ten Thousand
Monks Will Not Be Barred. A distant traveler like you can enjoy all you want. Go! Go!
Go! And don't interrupt our conversation!”
Having thanked them, Tripitaka turned and said to Pilgrim, “This is the
Numinous Earth District of the Bronze Estrade Prefecture.
The two old men told me that beyond the archway on the street running north
and south, there is a tiger-guarded towered gate facing east. That's the home of Squire
Kou, where before the door there is a plaque bearing the inscription, Ten Thousand
Monks Will Not Be Barred. They told us to go to that household to have a meal.”
“The region of the West,” said Sha Monk, “is the land of Buddha, so there must
be people who wish to feed the monks. If this is only a district or a prefecture, there's no
need for us to have our rescript certified. Let's go beg some food, and we can leave after
the meal.”
As the elder walked slowly through the long street with his three followers, they
aroused again such alarm and suspicion of those people in the markets that they all
crowded around the pilgrims to stare at their features. Telling his disciples to remain
silent, the elder kept saying, “Behave yourselves! Behave yourselves!”
The three of them indeed lowered their heads and dared not look up. After they
turned a corner, they came upon a broad street running north and south.
As they walked along, they saw a tiger-guarded towered-gate, on the other side
of which there was hung on the wall a huge plaque with the inscription, Ten Thousand
Monks Will Not Be Barred. “In this Buddha land of the West,” said Tripitaka, “there's
no deception in either the foolish or the wise. I was not prepared to believe what the two
aged men told me, but what I see here confirms their story.”
Always rude and impulsive, Eight Rules wanted to go in at once. Pilgrim said,
“Idiot, let's stop a moment. Wait till someone comes out. When we have obtained
permission, then you may enter.”
1259
1259
“What Big Brother says is quite right,” said Sha Monk. “If we do not observe
proper etiquette, we may offend the patron.”
They rested the horse and the luggage before the gate. In a little while, an old
retainer appeared, carrying in his hands a scale and a basket.
When he suddenly caught sight of the four, he was so startled that he abandoned
his possessions and ran inside to report, “My lord, there are four strange-looking priests
outside!”
The squire, leaning on his staff, was just taking a leisurely stroll in the courtyard,
chanting repeatedly the name of Buddha. The moment he heard this report, he threw
away his staff and hurried out to receive his visitors. When he saw the four pilgrims, he
was not intimidated by their ugliness. All he said was, “Please come in! Please come
in!” With modesty Tripitaka entered with his disciples. After going through a little
alley, the squire led them to a building and said, “This building houses the Buddha hall,
the sūtra hall, and the dining hall, which will entertain the Venerable Fathers. The
building to the left is where this disciple and his family live.”
Tripitaka was full of compliments as he put on his cassock to worship Buddha.
They ascended the hall to look around, and they saw
Fragrant clouds of incense,
And bright flames of candles;
A hall filled with bundles of silk and flowers,
Four corners festooned with gilt and colors.
On a vermilion prop
A bell of purple gold hangs high;
On colored lacquered frames
pair of patterned drums are mounted.
A few pairs of banners
All embroidered with the eight jewels;
A thousand Buddhas
All gilded in gold.
An old bronze censer,
And an old bronze vase;
A carved lacquered table,
And a carved lacquered box.
From the old bronze censer
Arise unending curls of smoky fragrance;
Within the old bronze vase
Now and then the lotus displays its colors.
Five-colored clouds fresh on the carved lacquered table;
Mounds of scented petals in the carved lacquered box.
In a crystal chalice,
The holy water's clear and clean;
In a lamp of glass,
The fragrant oil burns brightly.
The gold stone-chime's one note
Lingers and resonates.
Truly unsoiled by red dust in this precious tower,
A household Buddha-hall nobler than a temple.
1260
1260
Having purified his hands, the elder took up incense to kowtow and worship.
Then he turned to go through the proper ceremony of greeting the squire, who said,
however, “Just a moment! We shall do that in the sūtra room.”
There they saw
Square and erect cases—
Jade and gold boxes—
In square and erect cases
Countless volumes of sūtra pile up;
In jade and gold boxes
Many notes and letters are collected.
On the colored lacquered table
Are paper, ink, brush, and inkstone—
All exquisite items of the study.
Before the pepper-dusted screens
Are books, paintings, a psaltery, and chess—
All marvelous objects of real pleasure.
A divine stone-chime of jade o'erlaid with gold is placed there;
A grapevine mat that shields the moon and wind is hung there.
pure air makes one don a cheerful air;
A chaste mind sets free the mind of Dao.
Having reached the place, the elder was about to go through the ceremony when
he was stopped again by the squire, saying, “Please take off your Buddha robe.”
Tripitaka doffed his cassock, and only then was he allowed to give his host the
proper greeting. Then the squire also exchanged greetings with Pilgrim and his two
brothers. He asked his servants to feed the horse and to place the luggage in the
corridor. Only then did he inquire about the pilgrims' origin.
Tripitaka said, “Your humble cleric has been sent by royal decree of the Great
Tang in the Land of the East to visit the Spirit Mountain of your treasure region in order
to seek true scriptures from the Buddhist Patriarch. I heard that your honored household
reveres the monks, and that's why I came bowing. I would like to beg for a meal, and
then we shall leave.”
His face beaming with pleasure, the squire smiled broadly and said, “Your
disciple's surname is Kou. My given name is Hong (Great), and my style is Dakuan
(Liberality). I'm sixty-four years old. At the age of forty, I made a vow which would not
be fulfilled until I had fed ten thousand monks. This has been going on for twenty-four
years. I have kept a record of all those I have fed. Recently in my leisure hours, I went
through the names of the monks and discovered that I have fed nine thousand, nine
hundred, and ninety-six persons. Only four more remain before I reach the number of
perfection. It is indeed my good fortune that Heaven has sent me today you four old
masters to complete this number. Please leave me your honored titles, and you must stay
here for a month also. Please wait until we have performed the ceremony of the
completion of a vow. Your disciple will then escort you all to the mountain with horses
and carriages.
Our region is only some eight hundred miles from the Spirit Mountain. It's not
very far.”
1261
1261
Exceedingly pleased by what he heard, Tripitaka agreed to what he proposed,
and we shall leave them for the moment.
Several houseboys, old and young, went into the squire's residence to haul
firewood and bail water. They also took out rice, noodles, and vegetables in order to
prepare the dietary meal. All these activities led the aged wife of the squire to ask,
“Where do these monks come from, that they have to receive such special treatment?”
“When our master asked these four noble priests about their origin,” replied the
houseboys, “one of them said that they were sent by the Great Tang emperor to worship
our Holy Father Buddha in the Spirit Mountain. Who knows how great a distance they
have covered to reach our place, but our master said that they came from Heaven. He
told us to prepare a vegetarian meal quickly to entertain them.”
Delighted also by what she heard, the old woman said to her maid, “Get me
some clothes. I want to go meet them also.”
“Madam,” said one of the houseboys, “you want to meet only one of them, not
the other three. Their features are extremely ugly!”
“You people are just ignorant,” said the old woman. “When the features are
ugly, strange, or extraordinary, they must belong to celestial beings descending to the
Region Below. Run along now and announce my presence to your master.”
The houseboys dashed out to the sūtra hall to say to the squire, “Madam is here.
She wishes to meet the venerable fathers of the Land of the East.” On hearing this,
Tripitaka rose from his seat as the old woman arrived at the hall. She raised her eyes and
scrutinized the dignified and handsome features of the Tang Monk. Then she turned to
look at Pilgrim and his two companions, whose appearances were extraordinary indeed!
Though she thought that they were celestial beings descended to Earth, she did feel a
little nervous as she went to her knees to bow to them.
Hurriedly returning her salutation, Tripitaka said, “The Lady Bodhisattva has
erroneously paid us great homage.”
The old woman asked the squire, “Why aren't these four masters sitting
together?” Sticking out his snout, Eight Rules said, “We three are only disciples!”
Eeeee! That one declaration of his seemed like a tiger's roar deep in the
mountain! The old woman became more frightened than ever.
As they spoke, another houseboy came to say, “The two uncles have arrived.”
Turning quickly to look, Tripitaka found two young scholars who walked up the
sūtra hall and bent low toward the elder. Tripitaka hastily returned their greetings, while
the squire tugged at him and said, “These are my two sons, named Kou Liang (Beam)
and Kou Dong (Pillar). They have just returned from school and haven't had their lunch
yet. Learning of the master's arrival, they have come to bow to you.”
Delighted, Tripitaka said, “Excellent! Excellent! Truly
To exalt your house doing good's the rule.
To have good sons you must send them to school.”
“Where did this Venerable Father come from?” the two young men asked their
father.
“From a great distance,” replied the squire, laughing. “He is someone sent by the
Great Tang emperor in the Land of the East, at the South Jambūdvīpa Continent, to go
1262
1262
see the Holy Father Buddha at Spirit Mountain and acquire scriptures.” One scholar
said, “I read in A Guide through the Forest of Affairs that the world is divided into four
continents. Our region here belongs to the West Aparagodāniya Continent, and there is
also an East Pūrvavideha Continent. I wonder how many years it took him to travel
from South Jambūdvīpa to this place?” With a smile, Tripitaka said, “This humble cleric
on his journey has spent more days in being delayed than in traveling. Frequently I fell
to poisonous demons and savage fiends, to thousands of bitter ordeals. I am fortunate to
have the protection of my three disciples.
Altogether I have experienced fourteen summers and winters before arriving at
your treasure region.” When they heard this, the two scholars paid him effusive
compliments, saying, “Truly a divine monk! Truly a divine monk!”
Hardly had they finished speaking when a young boy came to say, “The maigre
has been spread out. We invite the Venerable Fathers to partake.”
The squire asked his wife to return to their residence with his sons. He himself
accompanied the four pilgrims to the dining hall for the meal.
The appointments in the hall were arranged in a most orderly manner, with
gilded lacquered tabletops and black-lacquered armchairs. The front row of food
consisted of a crouque-en-bouche of five colors, created in the latest fashion by the most
skillful and artistic hands. In the second row there were five platters of little dishes,
while the third row had five plates of fruits. The fourth row had five big platters of
snacks, every item delicious and fragrant. The vegetarian soups, the rice, the steamed
dumplings and buns were all steaming hot and most appetizing. Seven or eight
houseboys dashed back and forth to serve them, and four or five chefs never stopped
working. Look at them! Some brought in soup while others added rice; coming and
going, they were like meteors chasing the moon.
Our Zhu Eight Rules swallowed a bowlful with one gulp, and he went after the
food like wind sweeping away the clouds. Master and disciples thus enjoyed a full meal.
The elder rose and, having thanked the squire for the maigre, was about to leave
immediately. Stopping him, the squire said, “Old teacher, please relax and stay for a few
days. As the proverb says, „Beginning is easy but the end is hard.' Please wait till I have
performed the rite of completion. Only then would I dare escort you on your way.”
When Tripitaka saw how sincere and earnest he was, he had no choice but to remain.
Not until six or seven days had gone by did the squire invite some twenty-four
local Buddhist priests to conduct a service of the completion of a vow. The priests spent
three or four days to compose the service, and, having selected an auspicious date, they
began the sacrifice. Their manner, of course, was no different from that of the Great
Tang. They, too,
Unfurled the huge banners
And set up the gilded images;
Lifted high the tall candles
burned incense to worship.
They rolled drums and tapped cymbals;
They blew on reeds and kneaded pipes.
The little gongs
And the flute's pure tones
All followed the gongche notations.
1263
1263
They struck up the music
And played for a while
Before beginning to chant the sūtras aloud.
First they pacified the local spirits;
Next they called on divine warriors.
They burned and sent off the documents,
And they bowed to Buddha's images.
They recited the Peacock Sūtra,
Each sentence woe-dispelling;
They lighted the Bhaiṣajya Lamp,
Its flame both bright and blazing.
They did the Water Penitential
To dissolve guilt and enmity;
They proclaimed the Garland Sūtra
To remove slander and strife.
Triyāna's wondrous law had the finest aim;
One or two Śramaṇa were all the same.
For three days and nights it went on like that, and at last the service was over.
Thinking of Thunderclap, the Tang Monk wanted to leave. As he tried to thank his host,
the squire said, “The old teacher is so eager to leave! It must be that my preoccupation
with the service these last few days has caused me to slight you in some manner, and
you are offended.”
“I have greatly disturbed your noble residence,” replied Tripitaka, “and I do not
know how I can repay you. Dare I even speak of offense? It's just that when my sage
ruler escorted me out of the imperial pass, he asked me when I would return. By mistake
I replied that I should be back in three years. Little did I expect that I would be on the
road for fourteen years! And I still don't know whether I'd be able to acquire the
scriptures! By the time I have taken them back, it will probably be another twelve or
thirteen years. Would I not have violated the sage decree? What unbearable crime
would that be? I beg the old squire to let this humble cleric proceed. Wait till I have
acquired the scriptures; then I'll come back to stay a little longer at your mansion. That
should be permissible.” Unable to contain himself, Eight Rules shouted, “Master, you're
too insensitive to human wishes! You've no regard for human sentiments! The old
squire must be a very rich man if he has been able to make such a vow to feed priests.
Now that it is completed, and now that he is urging us so earnestly to stay, there's no
harm in our remaining a year or so. Why must you insist on leaving? Why should we
abandon such ready-made provisions and resume begging from someone else? What old
father or mother's family do you have ahead of you?”
“You coolie!” snapped the elder. “All you know is eating! You never have a
thought for returning to your origin. Truly you're a beast who cares only for
Eating in the trough
To ease your belly's itch!
Since you crave so much to indulge in this deluded passion, I'll leave tomorrow
by myself.” When Pilgrim saw that even the color of his master's face had changed, he
grabbed Eight Rules and pounded him with his fists.
“This Idiot,” he cried, “without knowing any better, has caused Master to blame
even us!”
1264
1264
“That's a good beating! That's a good beating!” said Sha Monk, chuckling.
“Even when he's silent, as he is now, he annoys people! Wait till he butts in again with
his mouth!” In a huff, our Idiot stood to one side and dared not utter another word.
When the squire saw that master and disciples had become agitated, he tried to placate
them with a broad smile, saying, “Please calm yourself, old teacher, and bear with us for
one more day. Tomorrow I shall prepare some banners and drums and invite a few
relatives and neighbors to see you off.”
As they conversed, the old woman appeared and said, “Old Master, if you have
come to our house, there is no need for you to rush off so eagerly. How many days have
you been staying, anyway?”
“Already half a month,” replied Tripitaka.
“Let that half-month be counted as the meritorious service of the squire,” said
the old woman. “I too have accumulated a little cash from sewing, and I have hopes also
of feeding the old master for half a month.” She had barely finished speaking when Kou
Dong and his brother also came out and said, “Please hear us, you four Venerable
Masters. Our father fed the monks for over twenty years, but he had never come upon a
good person. Now he is lucky enough to reach the number of perfection only because of
your arrival, which has, as it were, brought radiance to a thatched hut. Your students are
too young to know much about karma, but we do know the proverb:
What pa sows pa reaps;
What ma sows ma reaps;
One who sows not, reaps not.
The reason our father and mother wish to extend their hospitality is just so that
they may each attain certain karmic reward. Why must you refuse them so bitterly?
Even we foolish brothers have saved up a small sum from our school allowances, with
which we, too, would like to entertain the Venerable Masters for half a month before we
see you off.”
“Already I dare not accept the great kindness of your mother, the old
Bodhisattva,” said Tripitaka. “How could I presume upon the affection of you worthy
brothers? I truly dare not. I must leave this day, and I implore all of you to pardon me. If
I remained, I would have exceeded the imperial limit, and my crime would be even
greater than one punishable by execution.” When the old woman and her two sons saw
that he was adamant, they grew angry and said, “Out of good intentions we wanted him
to stay, but he's bent on leaving. All right! He wants to go, let him go! No need to
chatter any more!” Mother and sons thereupon got up and went inside.
Unable to restrain himself, Eight Rules spoke again to the Tang Monk, “Master,
don't overdo your playacting! As the proverb says,
To stay's appropriate.
Loitering irritates!
Let us stay here for one more month, just to satisfy the wishes of mother and
sons. What's the hurry?”
“Oh?” snapped the Tang Monk, and immediately our Idiot gave his own mouth a
couple of slaps, saying, “Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Don't talk! You're making noises again!”
On one side Pilgrim and Sha Monk began to giggle uncontrollably.
“What are you laughing at?” said the Tang Monk to Pilgrim, sorely annoyed.
Making the magic sign with his fingers, he was about to recite the Tight-Fillet Spell. So
1265
1265
horrified was Pilgrim that he at once went to his knees to say, “Master, I wasn't
laughing! I wasn't laughing! Don't recite that spell, I beg you!” When the squire saw
that master and disciples were becoming more and more rancorous, he dared not insist
on their staying any longer. All he said was, “The Venerable Masters need not quarrel. I
promise you that I shall escort you on your way tomorrow.”
He went out of the sūtra hall and told his secretary to send over a hundred
invitations to his relatives and neighbors to join him in sending off in the morning the
old master from the Tang court in his westward journey. In the meantime, he ordered
the chefs to prepare a farewell banquet, and his steward to have twenty pairs of colored
banners made up and to find a band of musicians and drummers. A group of monks
from the South Advent Monastery and a group of Daoists from the East Summit Abbey
were to be ready to join the party by the hour of the Serpent in the morning. His
domestic staff obeyed and left. In a little while, it was nightfall. After the evening meal,
they all retired. You see
A few crows to the village homeward fly.
Drums and bells toll from distant towers high.
Human traffic ceases in the street and mart;
From all households lights and fires now depart.
In moonlight and wind blossoms show their shade;
The stars the obscure silver stream pervade.
The night has deepened for the nightjars weep;
The heavens grow silent when the earth's asleep.
At the time it was no more than the hour between the third and fourth watch
when those houseboys in charge of various affairs all rose early in order to complete
their tasks. Look at them!
Those preparing the banquet
Rushed about in the kitchen;
Those making the colored banners
Clamored before the hall;
Those beckoning monks and priests
Sprinted on their two legs;
Those calling for musicians
Hurled themselves forward;
Those sending out invitations
Darted east and west;
Those readying horse and carriage
Shouted back and forth.
From the hour of midnight, the tumult lasted till dawn. By about the hour of the
Serpent, every business was concluded—with money, of course! We tell you now about
the Tang Monk and his disciples, who also rose early, attended by all those people. The
elder at once gave the instruction to pack and to hitch up the horse. When our Idiot
heard that they were truly about to leave, he pouted his fat lips some more and grumbled
incessantly, but he had no choice other than to pack up the cassock and almsbowl and
pick up the pole and its load.
Having brushed and scrubbed down the horse, Sha Monk saddled it and waited.
Pilgrim handed the nine-ringed priestly staff to his master and hung the satchel
containing his travel rescript on his own chest. They were about to walk out together
1266
1266
when the squire came to invite them to a large sitting room in the rear, where a huge
banquet was spread out. The hospitality they encountered here was quite different from
what they received in the dining hall in front. They saw
loftily hung
And screens on all four sides.
Hung in the center
Was a painting with the aged mountain and blessed sea motif;
Displayed on two walls
Were the scenes of spring, summer, autumn, and winter.
From dragon-veined tripods rose incense smoke;
Auspicious air grew in crow-tortoise urns.
The display-plates' many colors
Showed vivid bejeweled floral patterns;
The side tables' mounds of gold
Held orderly rows of lion-god candies.
Drums and dances followed the graceful notes;
Brocadelike food and fruits were placed in the hall.
Such refined vegetarian soup and rice!
Such attractive fragrant tea and wine!
Though this was a home of a commoner,
It was not different from a noble's house.
You could hear only a joyous hubbub
That truly disturbed Heaven and Earth.
The elder was just greeting the squire when a houseboy appeared and said, “The
guests have all arrived.”
These were all neighbors left and right, the wife's brothers, the cousins, and the
sisters' husbands. There were also squires who had jointly pledged to keep a diet, and
Buddhist believers. After all of them bowed ceremoniously to the elder, they took their
proper seats as pipes and strings played below the steps and the feasting went on inside
the hall.
This sumptuous spread had the undivided attention of Eight Rules, who said to
Sha Monk, “Brother, let yourself go and eat! When we leave the Kou home, there'll be
no more rich fare like this!”
“What are you saying, Second Elder Brother!” said Sha Monk, chuckling. “As
the proverb puts the matter
The hundred flavors of rare dainties
Are no more once you've eaten your fill.
You may accumulate private savings
But not in your stomach private hoardings!”
“You're much too feeble! Too feeble!” replied Eight Rules. “When I have eaten
to the limits in one meal, I won't be hungry again even after three days!”
Hearing him, Pilgrim said, “Idiot, don't puncture your belly! We have to be on
the road!”
Hardly had they finished speaking when it was almost noon. The elder, in his
seat of honor, lifted his chopsticks to recite the Sūtra for the End of Maigre. So alarmed
was Eight Rules that he took up the rice, downed one bowl with a gulp, and put away
1267
1267
five or six more bowls. Next he picked up those buns, rolls, cakes, and baked goods and
stuffed both his sleeves full of them, regardless of whether they were good or bad. Only
then did he leave the table, following his master. Having thanked the squire and the
other guests, the elder walked out of the door, encountering many colorful banners and
treasure canopies, drummers and musicians, on the other side. The two bands of Daoist
priests and Buddhist monks were just arriving.
With a smile the squire said to them, “All of you are late, and the old master is
eager to leave. There is no time for me to present you with the maigre. Allow me to
thank you when we come back.”
Those pulling the carriages, riding horses, or walking all stepped aside for the
four pilgrims to proceed. As they went forward, loud strains of music and the roll of
drums drifted skyward while banners and flags blotted out the sun. The whole place was
clogged by people, chariots, and horses, as everyone came to see Squire Kou sending
off the Tang Monk. The wealth and riches so displayed
Surpassed the enclosures of pearl and jade,
And rivaled those silken drapes of love.
Those monks played a Buddhist tune, after which the priests struck up a Taoist
melody, as they all escorted the pilgrims out of the prefectural city. When they reached
the tenth-mile wayside station, food and drink were served, and they toasted each other
once more as they bade farewell. The squire, however, still could not bear to part with
his guests.
Blinking back his tears, he said, “When the Venerable Master returns after
acquiring the scriptures, he must come to our house to stay for a few days. That'll be the
fulfillment of Kou Hong's wish.”
Deeply moved, Tripitaka thanked him repeatedly, saying, “If I reach the Spirit
Mountain and get to see the Buddhist Patriarch, your great virtue will be the first to be
told. On my return, I shall surely stop at your door to express my thanks!” Speaking in
this manner, they went on for two or three more miles. The elder earnestly bowed to
take leave of his host, and the squire had to turn back, wailing loudly. Truly
Vowing to feed monks, he'd return to wondrous knowledge;
But with no affinity he could not see Tathāgata.
We shall speak no more of Squire Kou, who escorted the pilgrims to the tenthmile wayside station and then returned with his other companions to his house. We tell
you instead about the master and his three disciples, who journeyed for some forty or
fifty miles, when the sky darkened. “It's getting late,” said the elder. “Where shall we
ask for lodging?”
Toting the luggage, Eight Rules pouted and said, “There's ready-made rice, but
you won't eat it! There's a house built with cool tiles but you won't live in it! All you
want is to hurry on some journey, like a lost soul going to a funeral! Now it's getting
late. If it rains, what are we going to do then?”
“You brazen cursed beast!” scolded the Tang Monk. “You're complaining
again! As the proverb says,
Chang'an may be fine,
But it's no place to linger in.
1268
1268
Wait till we reach the affinity of seeing the Buddhist Patriarch and acquire the
true scriptures. When we return to the Great Tang and report to our lord, we will let you
eat the rice from the imperial kitchen for several years. I hope, you cursed beast, you'll
become so bloated that you'll die and become an overstuffed ghost!” Our Idiot giggled
silently and dared not utter another word.
Pilgrim peered into the distance and discovered several buildings by the main
road. He said quickly to his master, “Let's rest over there! Let's rest over there!”
The elder drew near and saw that it was a shrine which had collapsed. On top of
the shrine was an old plaque, on which there was an inscription written in four dustcovered, faded words:
Bright Light Travel Court.
Dismounting, the elder said, “The Bodhisattva Bright Light was the disciple of
the Buddha of Flames and Five Lights. Because of his expedition against the Demon
King of Poisonous Fire, he was demoted and changed into the Spirit Officer of Five
Manifestations.
They must have a shrine keeper here.”
They all went inside, but they discovered that both rooms and corridors had
toppled and there was no sign of any human person. They would have turned and gone
back out were it not for the fact that dark clouds suddenly had gathered above and a
torrential rain descended. They had little choice but to find whatever shelter they could
in that dilapidated building and remain there in stealthy silence, fearing that they might
otherwise disturb some monstrous deviates. Either sitting or standing, they endured a
sleepless night. Ah! Truly

In pleasure you'd meet, too, calamity.
We do not know what was their condition when they proceeded in the morning;
let's listen to the explanation in the next chapter.
