            The Old Dragon King's foolish schemes transgress Heaven's decrees<br>
            Prime Minister Wei's letter seeks help from an official of the dead

        <p>
            For the time being, we shall make no mention of Guangrui serving in his post
            and Xuanzang practicing austerities. We tell you now about two worthies who lived on
            the banks of the river Jing outside the city of Chang'an: a fisherman by the name of
            Zhang Shao and a woodman by the name of Li Ding.
        </p>
        <p>
            The two of them were scholars who had passed no official examination,
            mountain folks who knew how to read. One day in the city of Chang'an, after they had
            sold the wood on the one's back and the carp in the other's basket, they went into a
            small inn and drank until they were slightly tipsy. Each carrying a bottle, they followed
            the bank of the Jing River and walked slowly back.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Brother Li,"</em> said Zhang Shao, <em>"in my opinion those who strive for fame will
                lose their lives on account of fame; those who live in quest of fortune will perish
                because of riches; those who have titles sleep embracing a tiger; and those who receive
                official favors walk with snakes in their sleeves. When you think of it, their lives cannot
                compare with our carefree existence, close to the blue mountains and fair waters. We
                cherish poverty and pass our days without having to quarrel with fate."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Brother Zhang,"</em> said Li Ding, <em>"there's a great deal of truth in what you say.
                But your fair waters cannot match my blue mountains."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"On the contrary,"</em> said Zhang Shao, <em>"your blue mountains cannot match my fair
                waters, in testimony of which I offer a lyric to the tune of 'Butterflies Enamored of
                Flowers' that says:
        </p>
        <blockquote><em>
                In a small boat o'er ten thousand miles of misty waves<br>
                I lean to the silent, single sail,<br>

                My mind cleansed, my care purged, here lacks wealth or fame;<br>
                Leisurely I pick stems of bulrushes and reeds.<br>

                At willowed banks and reeded bays<br>
                My wife and son join my joyous laugh.<br>

            Li Ding said, <em>"Your fair waters are not as good as my blue mountains. I also

            Pale reds and bright greens announce the warmth of spring;<br>
            Summer comes abruptly; so passes time.<br>
            Then autumn arrives (for it's an easy change)<br>
            With fragrant golden flowers<br>
            Most worthy of our joy;<br>
            And cold winter descends, swift as a finger snaps.<br>
            Ruled by no one, I'm free in all four climes."</blockquote>

            The two of them thus recited poems and songs and composed linking-verses.
            Arriving at the place where their ways parted, they bowed to take leave of each other.
            <em>"Elder Brother Li,"</em> said Zhang Shao, <em>"take care as you go on your way. When you
                climb the mountains, be wary of the tiger. If you were harmed, I would find, as the

            When Li Ding heard these words, he grew very angry saying, <em>"What a scoundrel
                you are! Good friends would even die for each other! But you, why do you say such
                unlucky things to me? If I'm to be harmed by a tiger, your boat will surely capsize in
                the river."</em>

            <em>"Elder Brother Li,"</em> said Zhang Shao, <em>"you say this because you have no idea
                what may befall you in your business, whereas I can predict what'll happen in my kind

            <em>"The kind of living you pick up on the waters,"</em> said Li Ding, <em>"is an exceedingly

            <em>"Here's something you don't know about,"</em> said Zhang Shao. <em>"In this city of

                follow his instructions when I lower my nets, and I've never missed in a hundred times.
                Today I went again to buy his prediction; he told me to set my nets at the east bend of
                the Jing River and to cast my line from the west bank. I know I'll come back with a fine
                catch of fishes and shrimps. When I go up to the city tomorrow, I'll sell my catch and
                buy some wine, and then I'll get together with you again, old brother."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The two men then parted.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is, however, a proverb:
            <em>"What is said on the road is heard in the grass."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            For you see, it happened that a yakṣa on patrol in the Jing River overheard the
            part of the conversation about not having missed a hundred times. He dashed back to the
            Water Crystal Palace and hastily reported to the Dragon King, shouting, <em>"Disaster!
                Disaster!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"What sort of disaster?"</em> asked the Dragon King.
            <em>"Your subject,"</em> said the yakṣa, <em>"was patrolling the river and overheard a
                conversation between a woodman and a fisherman. Before they parted, they said
                something terrible. According to the fisherman, there is a fortune teller on West Gate
                Street in the city of Chang'an who is most accurate in his calculations. Every day the
                fisherman gives him a carp, and he then consults the sticks in his sleeve, with the result
                that the fisherman has not missed once in a hundred times when he casts his line! If
                such accurate calculations continue, will not all our water kin be exterminated? Where
                will you find any more inhabitants for the watery region who will toss and leap in the
                waves to enhance the majesty of the Great King?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Dragon King became so angry that he wanted to take the sword and go at
            once up to Chang'an to slay the fortune teller. But his dragon sons and grandsons, the
            shrimp and crab ministers, the samli counselor, the perch Subdirector of the Minor
            Court, and the carp President of the Board of Civil Office all came from the side and
            said to him, <em>"Let the Great King restrain his anger. The proverb says, 'Don't believe
                everything you hear.' If the Great King goes forth like this, the clouds will accompany
                you and the rains will follow you. We fear that the people of Chang'an will be terrified
                and Heaven will be offended. Since the Great King has the power to appear or disappear
                suddenly and to transform into many shapes and sizes, let him change into a scholar.
                Then go to the city of Chang'an and investigate the matter. If there is indeed such a
                person, you can slay him without delay; but if there is no such person, there is no need
                to harm innocent people."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Dragon King accepted their suggestion; he abandoned his sword and
            dismissed the clouds and the rains.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reaching the river bank, he shook his body and changed into a white-robed
            scholar, truly with
        </p>
        <blockquote><em>

        <p>
            Coming out of the water, the Dragon King strode to the West Gate Street in the
            city of Chang'an. There he found a noisy crowd surrounding someone who was saying
            in a lofty and self-assured manner, <em>"Those born under the Dragon will follow their fate;
                those under the Tiger will collide with their physiognomies. The branches Yin3, Chen5,

                clash with the Planet Jupiter."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            When the Dragon King heard this, he knew that he had come upon the fortuneteller's place.
            Walking up to it and pushing the people apart, he peered inside to see

            Who was this man? He was actually the uncle of Yuan Tiankang, president of
            the Imperial Board of Astronomy in the present dynasty. The gentle man was truly a
            man of extraordinary appearance and elegant features; his name was known throughout
            the great country and his art was considered the highest in Chang'an. The Dragon King
            went inside the door and met the Master; after exchanging greetings, he was invited to
            take the seat of honor while a boy served him tea. The Master asked, <em>"What would you
                like to know?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Dragon King said, <em>"Please forecast the weather."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Master consulted his sticks and made his judgment:
        </p>
        <blockquote><em>
                Clouds hide the hilltop<br>
                And fog shrouds the tree.<br>
                The rain you'd divine<br>
                Tomorrow you'll see.
            </em></blockquote>
        <p>
            <em>"At what hour will it rain tomorrow, and how much rain will there be?"</em> asked
            the Dragon King. <em>"At the hour of the Dragon the clouds will gather,"</em> said the Master,
            <em>"and thunder will be heard at the hour of the Serpent. Rain will come at the hour of the
                Horse and reach its limit at the hour of the Sheep. There will be altogether three feet, three inches,
                and forty-eight drops of rain."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"You had better not be joking now,"</em> said the Dragon King, laughing. <em>"If it rains
                tomorrow and if it is in accordance with the time and the amount you prophesied, I shall
                present you with fifty taels of gold as my thanks. But if it does not rain, or if the amount
                and the hours are incorrect, I tell you truly that I shall come and break your front door to
                pieces and tear down your shop sign. You will be chased out of Chang'an at once so
                that you may no longer seduce the multitude."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"You may certainly do that,"</em> said the Master amiably. <em>"Good-bye for now.
                Please come again tomorrow after the rain."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Dragon King took leave and returned to his water residence. He was received by various aquatic deities,
            who asked, <em>"How was the Great King's visit to the
                soothsayer?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Yes, yes, yes,"</em> said the Dragon King, <em>"there is indeed such a person, but he's a
                garrulous fortune-teller. I asked him when it would rain, and he said tomorrow; I asked
                him again about the time and the amount, and he told me that clouds would gather at the
                hour of the Dragon, thunder would be heard at the hour of the Serpent, and that rain
                would come at the hour of the Horse and would reach its limit at the hour of the Sheep.
                Altogether there would be three feet, three inches, and forty-eight drops of water. I
                made a wager with him: if it is as he said, I'll reward him with fifty taels of gold. If
                there is the slightest error, I'll break down his shop and chase him away, so that he will
                not be permitted to seduce the multitude at Chang'an."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"The Great King is the supreme commander of the eight rivers,"</em> said the water
            kin, laughing, <em>"the great Dragon Deity in charge of rain. Whether there is going to be
                rain or not, only the Great King knows that. How dare he speak so foolishly? That
                soothsayer is sure to lose!"</em> While the dragon sons and grandsons were laughing at the
            matter with the fish and crab officials, a voice was heard suddenly in midair
            announcing, <em>"Dragon King of the Jing River, receive the imperial command."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            They raised their heads to look and saw a goldenrobed guardian holding the
            decree of the Jade Emperor and heading straight for the water residence. The Dragon
            King hastily straightened out his attire and burned incense to receive the decree. After
            he made his delivery, the guardian rose into the air and left.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Dragon King opened the decree, which said:
        </p>
        <blockquote><em>
                We bid the Eight-Rivers Prince<br>
                To call up thunder and rain;<br>
                Pour out tomorrow your grace<br>
                To benefit Chang'an's race.
            </em></blockquote>
        <p>
            The instructions regarding the hours and the amount of rain written on the
            decree did not even differ in the slightest from the soothsayer's prediction. So
            overwhelmed was the Dragon King that his spirit left him and his soul fled, and only
            after awhile did he regain consciousness. He said to his water kinsmen, <em>"There is indeed
                an intelligent creature in the world of dust! How well he comprehends the laws of
                Heaven and Earth! I'm bound to lose to him!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Let the Great King calm himself,"</em> said the samli counselor. <em>"Is it so difficult to
                get the better of the fortune-teller? Your subject here has a little plan that will silence
                that fellow for good."</em> When the Dragon King asked what the plan was, the counselor
            said, <em>"If the rain tomorrow misses the timing and the amount specified by a mere
                fraction, it will mean that his prediction is not accurate. Won't you have won? What's
                there to stop you then from tearing up his shop sign and putting him on the road?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Dragon King took his counsel and stopped worrying.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next day he ordered the Duke of Wind, the Lord of Thunder, the Boy of
            Clouds, and the Mother of Lightning to go with him to the sky above Chang'an. He
            waited until the hour of the Serpent before spreading the clouds, the hour of the Horse
            before letting loose the thunder, the hour of the Sheep before releasing the rain, and
            only by the hour of the Monkey did the rain stop.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were only three feet and forty drops of water, since the times were altered
            by an hour and the amount was changed by three inches and eight drops.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the rain, the Dragon King dismissed his followers and came down from the
            clouds, transformed once again into a scholar dressed in white. He went to the West
            Gate Street and barged into Yuan Shoucheng's shop. Without a word of explanation, he
            began to smash the shop sign, the brushes, and the ink slab to pieces. The Master,
            however, sat on his chair and remained unmoved, so the Dragon King unhinged the
            door and threatened to hit him with it, crying, <em>"You're nothing but a bogus prophet of
                good and evil, an imposter who deludes the minds of the people! Your predictions are
                incorrect; your words are patently false! What you told me about the time and quantity
                of today's rain was utterly inaccurate, and yet you dare sit so smugly and so high on
                your seat? Leave here at once before you are executed!"</em> Still Yuan Shoucheng was not
            at all intimidated. He lifted up his head and laughed scornfully.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"I'm not afraid!"</em> he said. <em>"Not in the least! I'm not guilty of death, but I fear that you have
                committed a
                mortal crime. You can fool other people, but you can't fool me! I recognize you, all
                right: you are not a white-robed scholar but the Dragon King of the Jing River. By
                altering the times and holding back the quantity of rain, you have disobeyed the decree
                of the Jade Emperor and transgressed the law of Heaven. On the dragon execution block
                you won't escape the knife! And here you are, railing at me!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            When the Dragon King heard these words, his heart trembled and his hair stood on end. He dropped the door
            quickly, tidied his clothes, and knelt before the Master saying, <em>"I beg the Master not to
                take offense. My previous words were spoken in jest; little did I realize that my prank
                would turn out to be such a serious crime. Now I have indeed transgressed the law of
                Heaven. What am I to do? I beseech the Master to save me. If you won't, I'll never let
                you go!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"I can't save you,"</em> said Shoucheng, <em>"I can only point out to you what may be a
                way of life."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"I'm willing to be instructed,"</em> said the Dragon.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Master said, <em>"You are to be executed tomorrow by the human judge, Wei
                Zheng, at the third quarter past the hour of noon. If you want to preserve your life, you
                must go quickly to plead your case before the present emperor Tang Taizong, for Wei
                Zheng is the prime minister before his throne. If you can win the emperor's favor, you'll
                be spared."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Hearing this, the Dragon took leave with tears in his eyes. Soon the red sun sank
            down and the moon arose. You see

            Our Dragon King of the Jing River did not even return to his water home; he
            waited in the air until it was about the hour of the Rat, when he descended from the
            clouds and mists and came to the gate of the palace. At this time the Tang emperor was
            just having a dream about taking a walk outside the palace in the moonlight, beneath the
            shades of flowers. The Dragon suddenly assumed the form of a human being and went
            up to him. Kneeling, he cried out, <em>"Your Majesty, save me, save me!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Who are you?"</em> asked Taizong. <em>"We would be glad to save you."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Your Majesty is the true dragon,"</em> said the Dragon King, <em>"but I am an accursed
                one. Because I have disobeyed the decree of Heaven, I am to be executed by a worthy
                subject of Your Majesty, the human judge Wei Zheng. I have therefore come here to
                plead with you to save me."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"If Wei Zheng is to be the executioner,"</em> said Taizong, <em>"we can certainly save
                you. You may leave and not worry."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Dragon King was delighted and left after expressing his gratitude.
            We tell you now about Taizong, who, having awakened, was still turning over in
            his mind what he had dreamed. Soon it was threefifths past the hour of the fifth watch,
            and Taizong held court for his ministers, both civil and martial. You see

        <p>
            After the ministers had paid their homage, they all went back to standing in rows
            according to their rank. The Tang emperor opened his dragon eyes to look at them one
            by one: among the civil officials were Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui, Xu Shizhi, Xu
            Jingzong, and Wang Guei; and among the military officials were Ma Sanbao, Duan
            Zhixian, Yin Kaishan, Cheng Yaojin, Liu Hongzhi, Hu Jingde, and Qin Shubao. Each
            one of them was standing there in a most solemn manner, but the prime minister Wei
            Zheng was not to be seen anywhere. The Tang emperor asked Xu Shizhi to come
            forward and said to him, <em>"We had a strange dream last night: there was a man who paid
                homage to us, calling himself the Dragon King of the Jing River. He said that he had
                disobeyed the command of Heaven and was supposed to be executed by the human
                judge Wei Zheng. He implored us to save him, and we gave our consent. Today only
                Wei Zheng is absent from the ranks. Why is that?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"This dream may indeed come true,"</em> answered Shizhi, <em>"and Wei Zheng must be
                summoned to court immediately. Once he arrives, let Your Majesty keep him here for a
                whole day and not permit him to leave. After this day, the dragon in the dream will be
                saved."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Tang emperor was most delighted: he gave the order at once to have Wei
            Zheng summoned to court.
        </p>
        <p>
            We speak now of prime minister Wei Zheng, who studied the movement of the
            stars and burned incense at his home that evening. He heard the cries of cranes in the air
            and saw there a Heavenly messenger holding the golden decree of the Jade Emperor,
            which ordered him to execute in his dream the old dragon of the Jing River at precisely
            the third quarter past the noon hour. Having thanked the Heavenly grace, our prime
            minister prepared himself in his residence by bathing himself and abstaining from food;
            he was also sharpening his magic sword and exercising his spirit, and therefore he did
            not attend court. He was terribly flustered when he saw the royal officer on duty
            arriving with the summons. Not daring, however, to disobey the emperor's command,
            he had to dress quickly and follow the summons into court, kowtowing and asking for
            pardon before the throne. The Tang emperor said, <em>"We pardoned indeed our worthy
                subject."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            At that time the various ministers had not yet retired from the court, and only
            after Wei Zheng's arrival was the curtain drawn up for the court's dismissal. Wei Zheng
            alone was asked to remain; he rode the golden carriage with the emperor to enter the
            chamber for relaxation, where he discussed with the emperor tactics for making the
            empire secure and other affairs of state. When it was just about midway between the
            hour of the Serpent and the hour of the Horse, the emperor asked the royal attendants to
            bring out a large chess set, saying, <em>"We shall have a game with our worthy subject."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The various concubines took out the chessboard and set it on the imperial table.
            After expressing his gratitude, Wei Zheng set out to play chess with the Tang emperor,
            both of them moving the pieces step by step into positions. It was completely in
            accordance with the instruction of the Classic of Chess:
        </p>
        <blockquote>The way of chess exalts discipline and caution; the most powerful pieces should
            remain in the center, the weakest ones at the flanks, and the less powerful ones at the
            corners. This is a familiar law of the chess player. The law says: <em>"You should rather
                lose a piece than an advantage. When you strike on the left, you must guard your
                right; when you attack in the rear, you must watch your front. Only when you have a
                secure front will you also have a rear, and only if you have a secure rear will you
                maintain your front. The two ends cannot be separated, and yet both must remain
                flexible and not be encumbered. Abroad formation should not be too loose, while a
                tight position should not be constricted.
                Rather than clinging on to save a single piece, it is better to sacrifice it in order to
                win; rather than moving without purpose, it is better to remain stationary in order to
                be self-supportive. When your adversary outnumbers you, your first concern is to
                survive; when you outnumber your adversary, you must strive to exploit your force.
                He who knows how to win will not prolong his fight; he who is a master of positions
                will not engage in direct combat; he who knows how to fight will not suffer defeat;
                and he who knows how to lose will not panic. For chess begins with proper
                engagement but ends in unexpected victory. If your enemy, even without being
                threatened, is bringing up his reinforcement, it is a sign of his intention to attack; if
                he deserts a small piece without trying to save it, he may be stalking a bigger piece.
                If he moves in a casual manner, he is a man without thoughts; response without
                thought is the way to defeat. The Classic of Poetry says:
                Approach with extreme caution
                As if facing a deep canyon.
                Such is the meaning thereof.
                The poem says:
                The chessboard's the earth; the pieces are the sky;
                The colors are light and dark as the whole universe.
                When playing reaches that skillful, subtle stage,
                Boast and laugh with the old Immortal of Chess.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The two of them, emperor and subject, played chess until three quarters past the
            noon hour, but the game was not yet finished. Suddenly Wei Zheng put his head on the
            table and fell fast asleep. Taizong laughed and said, <em>"Our worthy subject truly has worn
                himself out for the state and exhausted his strength on behalf of the empire. He has
                therefore fallen asleep in spite of himself."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Taizong allowed him to sleep on and did not arouse him. In a little while, Wei
            Zheng awoke and prostrated himself on the ground saying, <em>"Your subject deserves ten
                thousand deaths! Your subject deserves ten thousand deaths! Just now I lost
                consciousness for no reason at all. I beg Your Majesty's pardon for such insult against
                the emperor."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"What insult is there?"</em> said Taizong. <em>"Arise! Let us forget the old game and
                start a new one instead."</em> Wei Zheng expressed his gratitude. As he put his hand on a
            piece, a loud clamor was heard outside the gate. It was occasioned by the ministers Qin Shubao
            and Xu Mougong, who arrived with a dragon head dripping with blood. Throwing it in
            front of the emperor, they said, <em>"Your Majesty, we have seen seas turn shallow and
                rivers run dry, but a thing as strange as this we have never even heard of."</em>
        </p>
        <p> Taizong arose with Wei Zheng and said, <em>"Where did this thing come from?"</em></p>
        <p>
            <em>"South of the Thousand-Step Corridor,"</em> replied Shubao and Mougong, <em>"at the
                crossroads, this dragon head fell from the clouds. Your lowly subjects dare not withhold
                it from you."</em> In alarm, the Tang emperor asked Wei Zheng, <em>"What's the meaning
                of this?"</em>
            Turning to kowtow to him, Wei Zheng said, <em>"This dragon was executed just now
                by your subject in his dream."</em> When the Tang emperor heard this, he was seized with
            fear and said, <em>"When our worthy minister was sleeping, I did not see any movement of
                body or limb, nor did I perceive any scimitar or sword. How could you have executed
                this dragon?"</em> Wei Zheng replied, <em>"My lord, although</em>
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <em>
                My body was before my master,<br>
                I left Your Majesty in my dream;<br>
                My body before my master faced the unfinished game,<br>
                With dim eyes fully closed;<br>
                I left Your Majesty in my dream to ride the blessed cloud,<br>
                With spirit most eager and alert.<br>
                That dragon on the dragon execution block<br>
                Was bound up there by celestial hosts.<br>
                Your subject said,<br>
                For breaking Heaven's law,<br>
                You are worthy of death.<br>
                Now by Heaven's command,<br>
                I end your wretched life.'<br>
                The dragon listened in grief;<br>
                Your subject bestirred his spirit;<br>
                The dragon listened in grief,<br>
                Retrieving claws and scales to await his death;<br>
                Your subject bestirred his spirit,<br>
                Lifting robe and taking step to hold high his blade.<br>
                With one loud crack the knife descended;<br>
                And thus the head of the dragon fell from the sky."
            </em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            When Taizong heard these words, he was filled with both sadness and delight.
            The delight was caused by his pride in having a minister as good as Wei Zheng. If he
            had worthies of this kind in his court, he thought, need he worry about the security of
            his empire? He was saddened, however, by the fact that he had promised in his dream to
            save the dragon, and he had not anticipated that the creature would be killed in this
            manner. He had to force himself to give the order to Shubao that the dragon head be
            hung on display at the market, so that the populace of Chang'an might be informed.
            Meanwhile, he rewarded Wei Zheng, after which the various ministers dispersed.
        </p>
        <p>
            That night he returned to his palace in deep depression, for he kept remembering
            the dragon in the dream crying and begging for his life. Little did he expect that the turn
            of events would be such that the dragon still could not escape calamity. Having thought
            about the matter for a long time, he became physically and mentally drained. At about
            the hour of the second watch, the sound of weeping was heard outside the door of the
            palace, and Taizong became even more fearful. He was sleeping fitfully when he saw
            our Dragon King of the Jing River holding his head dripping with blood in his hand, and
            crying in a loud voice:
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Tang Taizong! Give me back my life! Give me back my life! Last night you
                were full of promises to save me. Why did you order a human judge in the daytime to
                have me executed? Come out, come out! I am going to argue this case with you before
                the King of the Underworld."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            He seized Taizong and would neither let go nor desist from his protestation.
            Taizong could not say a word; he could only struggle until perspiration covered his
            entire body. Just at the moment when it seemed that nothing could separate them,
            fragrant clouds and colorful mists appeared from the south. A Daoist priestess came
            forward and waved a willow twig. That headless dragon, still mourning and weeping,
            left at once toward the northwest. For you see, this was none other than the Bodhisattva
            Guanyin, who by the decree of Buddha was seeking a scripture pilgrim in the Land of
            the East. She was staying in the temple of the local spirit at the city of Chang'an when
            she heard in the night the weeping of demons and the crying of spirits. So she came
            specially to drive the accursed dragon away and to rescue the emperor. That dragon
            went directly to the court of the Underworld to file suit, of which we shall say no more.
        </p>
        <p>
            We now tell you about Taizong, who, when he awoke, could only yell aloud,
            <em>"Ghost! Ghost!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            He so terrified the queens of three palaces, the concubines of six chambers, and
            the attending eunuchs that they remained sleepless for the entire night. Soon it was the
            fifth watch, and all the officials of the court, both civil and military, were waiting for
            an
            audience outside the gate. They waited until dawn, but the emperor did not appear, and
            every one of them became apprehensive and restless. Only after the sun was high in the
            sky did a proclamation come out saying, <em>"We are not feeling too well. The ministers are
                excused from court."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Five or six days went by swiftly, and the various officials became so anxious
            that they were about to enter the court without summons and inquire after the throne.
            Just then the queen mother gave the order to have the physician brought into the palace,
            and so the multitude waited at the gate of the court for some news. In a little while, the
            physician came out and he was questioned about the emperor's illness. <em>"The pulse of
                His Majesty is irregular,"</em> said the physician, <em>"for it is weak as well as
                rapid. He blabbers about seeing ghosts. I also perceive that there were ten movements and one
                rest, but there is no breath left in his viscera. I am afraid that he will pass away
                within seven days."</em> When the various ministers heard this statement, they paled with
            fright.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this state of alarm, they again heard that Taizong had summoned Xu
            Mougong, Huguo Gong, and Yuchi Gong to appear before him. The three ministers
            hurried into the auxiliary palace, where they prostrated themselves. Speaking somberly
            and with great effort, Taizong said, <em>"My worthy subjects, since the age of nineteen I
                have been leading my army in expeditions to the four corners of the Earth. I have
                experienced much hardship throughout the years, but I have never encountered any kind
                of strange or weird thing. This day, however, I have seen ghosts!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"When you established your empire,"</em> said Yuchi Gong, <em>"you had to kill
                countless people. Why should you fear ghosts?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"You may not believe it,"</em> said Taizong, <em>"but outside this bedroom of mine at
                night, there are bricks thrown and spirits screaming to a degree that is truly
                unmanageable. In the daytime it's not too bad, but it's intolerable at night!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Let Your Majesty be relieved,"</em> said Shubao, <em>"for this evening your subject and
                Jingde will stand guard at the palace gate. We shall see what sort of ghostly business
                there is."</em>
            Taizong agreed to the proposal, and Mougong and the other ministers retired
            after expressing their gratitude.
        </p>
        <p>
            That evening the two ministers, in full battle dress and holding golden bludgeon
            and battle-ax, stood guard outside the palace gate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dear generals! Look how they are attired:
        </p>
        <p>
            They wore on their heads bright glimmering golden helmets,
            And on their bodies cuirasses of dragon scales.
            Their jeweled breastplates glow like hallowed clouds:
            With lion knots tightly drawn,
            And silk sashes newly spun.
            This one had phoenix eyes facing the sky to frighten the stars:
            The other had brown eyes glowering like lightning and the shining moon.
            They were once warriors of the greatest merit;
            But now they've become
            For all time the guardians of the gates,
            In all ages the protectors of the home.
        </p>
        <p>
            The two generals stood beside the door for the entire night and did not see the
            slightest disturbance. That night Taizong rested peacefully in the palace; when morning
            came he summoned the two generals before him and thanked them profusely, saying,
            <em>"Since falling ill, I haven't been able to sleep for days, and only last night did I
                manage
                to get some rest because of your presence. Let our worthy ministers retire now for some
                rest so that we may count on your protection once again at night."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The two generals left after expressing their gratitude, and for the following two
            or three nights their standing guard brought continued peace. However, the royal
            appetite diminished and the illness became more severe. Taizong, moreover, could not
            bear to see the two generals overworked. So once again he called Shubao, Jingde, the
            ministers Du and Fang into the palace, saying to them, <em>"Though I got some rest these
                past two days, I have imposed on the two generals the hardship of staying up all night.
                I wish to have portraits made of both of them by a skilled painter and have these pasted
                on the door, so that the two generals will be spared any further labor. How about
                it?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The various ministers obeyed; they selected two portrait painters, who made
            pictures of the two generals in their proper battle attire. The portraits were then mounted
            near the gate, and no incident occurred during the night.
        </p>
        <p>
            So it was for two or three days, until the loud rattling of bricks and tiles was
            again heard at the rear gate of the palace. At dawn the emperor called together the
            various ministers, saying to them, <em>"For the past few days there have been, happily, no
                incidents at the front of the palace, but last night the noises at the back door were
                such that they nearly frightened me to death."</em> Mougong stepped forward and said,
            <em>"The disturbances at the front door were driven off by Jingde and Shubao. If there is
                disturbance at the rear gate, then Wei Zheng ought to stand guard."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Taizong approved the suggestion and ordered Wei Zheng to guard the rear door
            that night. Accepting the charge, Wei donned his full court regalia that evening; holding
            the sword with which he had slain the dragon, he stood at attention before the rear gate
            of the palace. What splendid heroic stature! Look how he is attired:
        </p>
        <blockquote><em>
                Green satin turban swaths his brow:<br>
                The silk robe's jade belt is waist-hung;<br>
                Windblown, craned-down sleeves fly like drifting snow.<br>
                He bests Lü and Shu's divine looks.<br>
                His feet wear black boots most supple;<br>
                His hands hold a blade sharp and fierce.<br>
                With glaring eyes he stared at all four sides.<br>
                Which deviant god dares approach?
            </em></blockquote>
        <p>
            A whole night went by and no ghost appeared. But though there were no
            incidents at either the front or the rear gate, the emperor's condition worsened. One day
            the queen mother sent for all the ministers to discuss funeral arrangements. Taizong
            himself also summoned Xu Mougong to his bedside to entrust to him the affairs of state,
            committing the crown prince to the minister's care as Liu Bei did to Zhuge Liang.
        </p>
        <p>
            When he had finished speaking, he bathed and changed his garments, waiting for
            his time to come. Wei Zheng then stepped out from the side and tugged the royal
            garment with his hand, saying, <em>"Let Your Majesty be relieved. Your subject knows
                something that will guarantee long life for Your Majesty."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"My illness,"</em> said Taizong, <em>"has reached the irremediable stage; my life is in
                danger. How can you preserve it?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Your subject has a letter here,"</em> said Wei, <em>"which I submit to Your Majesty to
                take with you to Hell and give to the Judge of the Underworld, Jue."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Who is Cui Jue?"</em> asked Taizong.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Cui Jue,"</em> said Wei, <em>"was the subject of the deceased emperor, your father: at
                first he was the district magistrate of Cizhou, and subsequently he was promoted to vice
                president of the Board of Rites. When he was alive, he was an intimate friend and sworn
                brother of your subject. Now that he is dead, he has become a judge in the capital of
                the Underworld, having in his charge the chronicles of life and death in the region of
                darkness. He meets with me frequently, however, in my dreams. If you go there
                presently and hand this letter to him, he will certainly remember his obligation toward
                your lowly subject and allow Your Majesty to return here. Surely your soul will return
                to the human world, and your royal countenance will once more grace the capital."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            When Taizong heard these words, he took the letter in his hands and put it in his sleeve;
            with that, he closed his eyes and died. Those queens and concubines from three palaces
            and six chambers, the crown prince and the two rows of civil and military officials, all
            put on their mourning garb to mourn him, as the imperial coffin lay in state at the Hall
            of the White Tiger, but we shall say no more about that.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not know how the soul of Taizong came back; let's listen to the explanation in the next chapter.
