        </p>
        <p>The principal aim of this chapter is to make clear that the way to acquire scriptures is no different from
            the way of attending to the fundamentals in one's life.</p>
        <p>We now tell you about master and disciples, the four of them, who, having awakened to the suchness of all
            things, broke free from the fetters of dust. Leaping clear from the sea of nature's flowing sand, they were
            completely rid of any hindrance and proceeded westward on the main road. They passed through countless green
            hills and blue waters; they saw wild grass and untended flowers in endless arrays. Time was swift indeed and
            soon it was autumn again. You see</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maple leaves redden the mountain;</li>
            <li>Yellow blooms endure the night-wind.</li>
            <li>Old cicada's song turns languid;</li>
            <li>Sad crickets ever voice their plaint.</li>
            <li>Cracked lotus leaves like green silk fans;</li>
            <li>Fragrant oranges like gold balls.</li>
            <li>Lovely, those rows of wild geese,</li>
            <li>In dots they spread to distant sky.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As they journeyed, it was getting late again. <em>"Disciples,"</em> said Tripitaka, <em>"it's getting late.
                Where shall we
                go to spend the night?"</em></p>
        <p><em>"Master,"</em> said Pilgrim, <em>"what you said is not quite right. Those who have left home dine on the
                winds and
                rest beside the waters; they sleep beneath the moon and lie on the frost; in short, any place can be
                their
                home. Why ask where we should spend the night?"</em></p>
        <p><em>"Elder Brother,"</em> said Zhu Eight Rules, <em>"all you seem to care about is making progress on the
                journey, and
                you've no concern for the burdens of others. Since crossing the Flowing-Sand River, we have been doing
                nothing but scaling mountains and peaks, and hauling this heavy load is becoming rather hard on me.
                Wouldn't
                it be much more reasonable to look for a house where we can ask for some tea and rice, and try to regain
                our
                strength?"</em></p>
        <p><em>"Idiot,"</em> said Pilgrim, <em>"your words sound as if you begrudge this whole enterprise. If you think
                that you are
                still back in the Gao Village, where you can enjoy the comfort that comes to you without your exerting
                yourself, then you won't make it! If you have truly embraced the faith of Buddhism, you must be willing
                to
                endure pain and suffering; only then will you be a true disciple."</em></p>
        <p>299</p>
        <p>299</p>
        <p><em>"Elder Brother,"</em> said Eight Rules, <em>"how heavy do you think this load of luggage is?"</em>
            Pilgrim said, <em>"Brother,
                since you and Sha Monk joined us, I haven't had a chance to pole it. How would I know its weight?"</em>
        </p>
        <p><em>"Ah! Elder Brother,"</em> said Eight Rules, <em>"just count the things here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Four yellow rattan mats;</li>
            <li>Long and short, eight ropes in all.</li>
            <li>To guard against dampness and rain,</li>
            <li>There are blankets—three, four layers!</li>
            <li>The flat pole's too slippery, perhaps?</li>
            <li>You add nails on nails at both ends!</li>
            <li>Cast in iron and copper, the nine-ringed priestly staff.</li>
            <li>Made of bamboo and rattan, the long, large cloak.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With all this luggage, you should pity old Hog, who has to walk all day carrying it! You only are the
            disciple of our master:<br>
            I've been made into a long-term laborer!"</em></p>
        <p><em>"Idiot!"</em> said Pilgrim with a laugh, <em>"to whom are you protesting?"</em></p>
        <p><em>"To you, Elder Brother,"</em> said Eight Rules. <em>"If you're protesting to me,"</em> said Pilgrim,
            <em>"you've made a
                mistake! Old Monkey is solely concerned with Master's safety, whereas you and Sha Monk have the special
                responsibility of looking after the luggage and the horse. If you ever slack off, you'll get a good
                whipping
                in the shanks from this huge rod!"</em>
        </p>
        <p><em>"Elder Brother,"</em> said Eight Rules, <em>"don't mention whipping, for that only means taking advantage
                of others by
                brute force. I realize that you have a proud and haughty nature, and you are not about to pole the
                luggage.
                But look how fat and strong the horse is that Master is riding: he's only carrying one old monk. Make
                him
                take a few pieces of luggage, for the sake of fraternal sentiment!"</em></p>
        <p><em>"So you think he's a horse!"</em> said Pilgrim. <em>"He's no earthly horse, for he is originally the son
                of Aorun, the
                Dragon King of the Western Ocean. Because he set fire to the palace and destroyed some of its pearls,
                his
                father charged him with disobedience and he was condemned by Heaven. He was fortunate to have the
                Bodhisattva Guanyin save his life, and he was placed in the Eagle Grief Stream to await Master's
                arrival. At
                the appropriate time, the Bodhisattva also appeared personally to take off his scales and horns and to
                remove the pearls around his neck. It was then that he changed into this horse to carry Master to
                worship
                Buddha in the Western Heaven. This is a matter of achieving merit for each one of us individually, and
                you
                shouldn't bother him."</em> When Sha Monk heard these words, he asked, <em>"Elder Brother, is he really
                a dragon?"</em>
        </p>
        <p><em>"Yes,"</em> replied Pilgrim. Eight Rules said, <em>"Elder Brother, I have heard an ancient saying that a
                dragon can
                breathe out clouds and mists, kick up dust and dirt, and he even has the ability to leap over mountains
                and
                peaks, the divine power to stir up rivers and seas. How is it that he is walking so slowly at the
                moment?"</em>
        </p>
        <p><em>"You want him to move swiftly?"</em> said Pilgrim. <em>"I'll make him do that. Look!"</em></p>
        <p>Dear Great Sage! He shook his goldenhooped rod once, and there were ten thousand shafts of colorful lights!
            When that horse saw the rod, he was so afraid that he might be struck by it that he moved his four legs like
            lightning and darted away. As his hands were weak, the master could not restrain the horse from this display
            of its mean</p>
        <p>nature. The horse ran all the way up a mountain cliff before slowing down to a trot. The master finally
            caught his breath, and that was when he discovered in the distance several stately buildings beneath some
            pine trees. He saw</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Doors draped by hanging cedars:</li>
            <li>Houses beside a green hill;</li>
            <li>Pine trees fresh and straight.</li>
            <li>And some poles of mottled bamboo.</li>
            <li>By the fence wild chrysanthemums glow with the frost:</li>
            <li>By the bridge orchid reflections redden the stream.</li>
            <li>Walls of white plaster;</li>
            <li>And fences brick-laid.</li>
            <li>A great hall, how noble and august:</li>
            <li>A tall house, so peaceful and clean.</li>
            <li>No oxen or sheep are seen, nor hens or dogs.</li>
            <li>After autumn's harvest farm chores must be light.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As the master held on to the saddle and slowly surveyed the scenery, Wukong and his brothers arrived.
            <em>"Master,"</em> said Wukong, <em>"you didn't fall off the horse?"</em>
        </p>
        <p><em>"You brazen ape!"</em> scolded the elder. <em>"You were the one who frightened the horse! It's a good
                thing I managed
                to stay on him!"</em></p>
        <p>Attempting to placate him with a smile, Pilgrim said, <em>"Master, please don't scold me. It all began when
                Zhu
                Eight Rules said that the horse was moving too slowly: so I made him hurry a little."</em></p>
        <p>Because he tried to catch up with the horse, Idiot ran till he was all out of breath, mumbling to himself,
            <em>"I'm done, done! Look at this belly of mine, and the slack torso! Already the pole is so heavy that I
                can
                hardly carry it. Now I'm given the additional bustle and toil of running after this horse!"</em>
        </p>
        <p><em>"Disciples,"</em> said the elder, <em>"look over there. There's a small village where we may perhaps ask
                for lodging."</em>
            When Pilgrim heard these words, he looked up and saw that it was covered by auspicious clouds and hallowed
            mists. He knew then that this place had to be a creation of buddhas or immortals, but he dared not reveal
            the Heavenly secret. He only said, <em>"Fine! Fine! Let's go ask for shelter."</em> Quickly dismounting, the
            elder
            discovered that the towered entrance gate was decorated with carved lotus designs and looped slits in the
            woodwork; its pillars were carved and its beams gilded. Sha Monk put down the luggage, while Eight Rules led
            the horse, saying, <em>"This must be a family of considerable wealth!"</em> Pilgrim would have gone in at
            once, but
            Tripitaka said, <em>"No, you and I are priests, and we should behave with circumspection. Don't ever enter a
                house without permission. Let's wait until someone comes out, and then we may request lodging
                politely."</em></p>
        <p>Eight Rules tied up the horse and sat down, leaning against the wall. Tripitaka sat on one of the stone drums
            while Pilgrim and Sha Monk seated themselves at the foot of the gate. They waited for a long time, but no
            one came out.</p>
        <p>Impatient by nature, Pilgrim leaped up after a while and ran inside the gate to have a look. There were, in
            fact, three large halls facing south, each with its curtains drawn up highly. Above the door screen hung a
            horizontal scroll painting with motifs of long life and rich blessings. And pasted on the gold lacquered
            pillars on either side was this new year couplet written on bright red paper:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Frail willows float like gossamer, the low bridge at dusk:</li>
            <li>Snow dots the fragrant plums, a small yard in the spring.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the center hall, there was a small black lacquered table, its luster half gone, bearing an old bronze urn
            in the shape of a beast. There were six straight-backed chairs in the main hall, while hanging screens were
            mounted on the walls east and west just below the roof.</p>

        <h2>Journey to the West Excerpt</h2>
        <p>As Pilgrim was glancing at all this furtively, the sound of footsteps suddenly came from behind the door to
            the rear, and out walked a middle-aged woman who asked in a seductive voice, <em>"Who are you, that you dare
                enter a widow's home without permission?"</em></p>
        <p>The Great Sage was so taken aback that he could only murmur his reply: <em>"This humble monk came from the
                Great
                Tang in the Land of the East, having received the royal decree to seek scriptures from Buddha in the
                West.
                There are four of us altogether. As we reached your noble region, it became late, and we therefore
                approached the sacred abode of the old Bodhisattva to seek shelter for the night."</em></p>
        <p>Smiling amiably, the woman said, <em>"Elder, where are your other three companions? Please invite them to
                come
                in."</em></p>
        <p><em>"Master,"</em> shouted Pilgrim in a loud voice, <em>"you are invited to come in."</em> Only then did
            Tripitaka enter with
            Eight Rules and Sha Monk, who was leading the horse and carrying the luggage as well. The woman walked out
            of the hall to greet them, where she was met by the furtive, wanton glances of Eight Rules. <em>"How did she
                look?"</em> you ask.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>She wore a gown of mandarin green and silk brocade,</li>
            <li>Topped by a light pink vest,</li>
            <li>To which was fastened a light yellow embroidered skirt;</li>
            <li>Her high-heeled, patterned shoes glinted beneath.</li>
            <li>A black lace covered her stylish coiffure,</li>
            <li>Nicely matching the twin-colored braids like dragons coiled.</li>
            <li>Her ivory palace-comb, gleaming red and halcyon-blue,</li>
            <li>Supported two gold hair-pins set aslant.</li>
            <li>Her half-grey tresses swept up like phoenix wings;</li>
            <li>Her dangling earrings had rows of precious pearls.</li>
            <li>Still lovely even without powder or rouge,</li>
            <li>She had charm and beauty like one fair youth.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When the woman saw the three of them, she became even more amiable and invited them with great politeness
            into the main hall.</p>
        <p>After they had exchanged greetings one after the other, the pilgrims were told to be seated for tea to be
            served. From behind the screen a young maid with two tufts of flowing locks appeared, holding a golden tray
            with several white-jade cups. There were</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fragrant tea wafting warm air,</li>
            <li>Strange fruits spreading fine aroma.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That lady rolled up her colorful sleeves and revealed long, delicate fingers like the stalks of spring
            onions; holding high the jade cups, she passed the tea to each one of them, bowing as she made the
            presentation. After the tea, she gave instructions for vegetarian food to be prepared. <em>"Old
                Bodhisattva,"</em>
            said Tripitaka bowing, <em>"what is your noble surname? And what is the name of your esteemed region?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>302</p>
        <p>302</p>
        <p>The woman said, <em>"This belongs to the West Aparagodānīya Continent. My maiden surname is Jia (Unreal), and
                the
                surname of my husband's family is Mo (Nonexisting). Unfortunately, my in-laws died prematurely, and my
                husband and I inherited our ancestral fortune, which amounted to more than ten thousand taels of silver
                and
                over fifteen thousand acres of prime land. It was fated, however, that we should have no son, having
                given
                birth only to three daughters. The year before last, it was my great misfortune to lose my husband also,
                and
                I was left a widow. This year my mourning period is completed, but we have no other relatives beside
                mother
                and daughters to inherit our vast property and land. I would have liked to marry again, but I find it
                difficult to give up such wealth. We are delighted, therefore, that the four of you have arrived, for we
                four, mother and daughters, would like very much to ask you to become our spouses. I do not know what
                you
                will think of this proposal."</em> When Tripitaka heard these words, he turned deaf and dumb; shutting
            his eyes
            to quiet his mind, he fell silent and gave no reply. The woman said, <em>"We own over three hundred acres of
                paddies, over four hundred and sixty acres of dried fields, and over four hundred and sixty acres of
                orchards and forests. We have over a thousand head of yellow water buffalo, herds of mules and horses,
                countless pigs and sheep. In all four quarters, there are over seventy barns and haystacks. In this
                household there is grain enough to feed you for more than eight or nine years, silk that you could not
                wear
                out in a decade, gold and silver that you might spend for a lifetime. What could be more delightful than
                our
                silk sheets and curtains, which can render spring eternal? Not to mention those who wear golden hairpins
                standing in rows! If all of you, master and disciples, are willing to change your minds and enter the
                family
                of your wives, you will be most comfortable, having all these riches to enjoy. Will that not be better
                than
                the toil of the journey to the West?"</em> Like a mute and stupid person, Tripitaka refused to utter a
            word.</p>
        <p>The woman said, <em>"I was born in the hour of the Cock, on the third day of the third month, in the year
                Dinghai. As my deceased husband was three years my senior, I am now forty-five years old. My eldest
                daughter, named Zhenzhen, is twenty; my second daughter, Aiai, is eighteen; and my youngest daughter,
                Lianlian, is sixteen. None of them has been betrothed to anyone. Though I am rather homely, my daughters
                fortunately are rather good-looking. Moreover, each of them is well trained in needlework and the
                feminine
                arts. And because we had no son, my late husband brought them up as if they were boys, teaching them
                some of
                the Confucian classics when they were young as well as the art of writing verse and couplets. So,
                although
                they reside in a mountain home, they are not vulgar or uncouth persons; they would make suitable
                matches, I
                dare say, for all of you. If you elders can put away your inhibitions and let your hair grow again, you
                can
                at once become masters of this household. Are not the silk and brocade that you will wear infinitely
                better
                than the porcelain almsbowl and black robes, the straw sandals and grass hats?"</em> Sitting aloft in
            the seat of
            honor, Tripitaka was like a child struck by lightning, a frog smitten by rain. With eyes bulging and rolling
            upward, he could barely keep himself from keeling over in his chair. But Eight Rules, hearing of such wealth
            and such beauty, could hardly quell the unbearable itch in his heart! Sitting on his chair, he kept turning
            and twisting as if a needle were pricking him in the ass. Finally he could restrain himself no longer.
            Walking forward, he tugged at his master, saying, <em>"Master! How can you completely ignore what the lady
                has
                been saying to you? You must try to pay some attention."</em> Jerking back his head, the priest gave
            such a
            hostile shout that Eight Rules backed away hurriedly. <em>"You cursed</p>
        <p>303</p>
        <p>303</p>
        <p>beast!"</em> he bellowed. <em>"We are people who have left home. How can we possibly allow ourselves anymore
                to be
                moved by riches and tempted by beauty?"</em></p>
        <p>Giggling, the woman said, <em>"Oh dear, dear! Tell me, what's so good about those who leave home?"</em></p>
        <p><em>"Lady Bodhisattva,"</em> said Tripitaka, <em>"tell me what is so good about those of you who remain at
                home?"</em></p>
        <p><em>"Please take a seat, elder,"</em> said the woman, <em>"and let me tell you the benefits in the life of
                those of us who
                remain at home. If you ask what they are, this poem will make them abundantly clear.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When spring fashions appear I wear new silk;</li>
            <li>Pleased to watch summer lilies I change to lace.</li>
            <li>Autumn brings fragrant rice-wine newly brewed.</li>
            <li>In winter's heated rooms my face glows with wine.</li>
            <li>I may enjoy the fruits of all four climes</li>
            <li>And every dainty of eight seasons, too.</li>
            <li>The silk sheets and quilts of the bridal eve</li>
            <li>Best the mendicant's life of Buddhist chants."</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tripitaka said, <em>"Lady Bodhisattva, you who remain in the home can enjoy riches and glory; you have things
                to
                eat, clothes to wear, and children by your side. That is undeniably a good life, but you do not know
                that
                there are some benefits in the life of those of us who have left home. If you ask what they are, this
                poem
                will make them abundantly clear.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The will to leave home is no common thing:</li>
            <li>You must tear down the old stronghold of love!</li>
            <li>No cares without, tongue and mouth are at peace;</li>
            <li>Your body within has good yin and yang.</li>
            <li>When merit's done, you face the Golden Arch</li>
            <li>And go hack, mind enlightened, to your Home.</li>
            <li>It beats the life of lust for household meat:</li>
            <li>You rot with age, one stinking bag of flesh!"</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>When the woman heard these words, she grew terribly angry, saying, <em>"How dare you to be so insolent, you
                brazen monk! If I had had no regard for the fact that you have come from the Land of the East, I would
                have
                sent you away at once. Now, I was trying to ask you, with all sincerity, to enter our family and share
                our
                wealth, and you insult me instead. Even though you have received the commandments and made the vow never
                to
                return to secular life, at least one of your followers could become a member of our family.</p>

        <p>Why are you being so legalistic?"</em> Seeing how angry she had become, Tripitaka was intimidated and said,
            <em>"Wukong, why don't you stay here."</em> Pilgrim said, <em>"I've been completely ignorant in such matters
                since the
                time I was young. Let Eight Rules stay."</em> <em>"Elder Brother,"</em> said Eight Rules, <em>"don't
                play tricks on people.
                Let's all have some further discussion."</em> <em>"If neither of you is willing,"</em> said Tripitaka,
            <em>"I'll ask Wujing to
                stay."</em> <em>"Listen to the way Master is speaking!"</em> said Sha Monk. <em>"Since I was converted
                by the Bodhisattva and
                received the commandments from her, I've been waiting for you. It has been scarcely two months since you
                took me as your disciple and gave me your teachings, and I have yet to acquire even half an inch of
                merit.
                You think I would dare seek such riches! I will journey to the Western Heaven even if it means my death!
                I'll never engage in such perfidious activities!"</em> When the woman saw them refusing to remain, she
            quickly
            walked behind the screen and slammed the door to the rear. Master and disciples were left outside, and no
            one came out again to present tea or rice.
        </p>
        <p>Exasperated, Eight Rules began to find fault with the Tang Monk, saying, <em>"Master, you really don't know
                how
                to handle these matters! In fact, you have ruined all our chances by the way you spoke! You could have
                been
                more flexible and given her a vague reply so that she would at least have given us a meal. We would at
                least
                have enjoyed a pleasant evening, and whether we would be willing to stay tomorrow or not would have been
                for
                us to decide. Now the door is shut and no one is going to come out. How are we going to last through the
                night in the midst of these empty ashes and cold stoves?"</em></p>
        <p><em>"Second Brother,"</em> said Wujing, <em>"why don't you stay here and become her sonin-law?"</em> Eight
            Rules said,
            <em>"Brother, don't play tricks on people. Let's discuss the matter further."</em> <em>"What's there to
                discuss?"</em> said
            Pilgrim. <em>"If you are willing, Master and that woman will become in-laws, and you will be the son-in-law
                who
                lives in the girl's home. With such riches and such treasures in this family, you will no doubt be given
                a
                huge dowry and a nice banquet to greet the kinsfolk, which all of us can also enjoy. Your return to
                secular
                life here will in fact benefit both parties concerned."</em> <em>"You can say that all right,"</em> said
            Eight Rules, <em>"but
                for me it's a matter of fleeing the secular life only to return to secular life, of leaving my wife only
                to
                take another wife."</em> <em>"So, Second Brother already has a wife?"</em> said Sha Monk. <em>"You
                didn't realize,"</em> Pilgrim
            said, <em>"that originally he was the son-in-law of Mr. Gao of the Old Gao Village, in the Kingdom of Qoco.
                Since I defeated him, and since he had earlier received the commandments from the Bodhisattva, he had
                little
                choice but to follow the priestly vocation. That's the reason he abandoned his former wife to follow
                Master
                and to go worship Buddha in the Western Heaven. I suppose he has felt the separation keenly and has been
                brooding on it for some time. Just now, when marriage was mentioned, he must have been sorely tempted.
                Idiot, why don't you become the son-in-law of this household? Just make sure that you make a few extra
                bows
                to old Monkey, and you won't be reprimanded!"</em>
        </p>
        <p><em>"Nonsense! Nonsense!"</em> said Idiot. <em>"Each one of us is tempted, but you only want old Hog to be
                embarrassed.
                The proverb says, „A monk is the preta of sensuality,' and which one of us can truly say that he doesn't
                want this? But you have to put on a show, and your histrionics have ruined a good thing. Now we can't
                even
                get a drop of tea or water, and no one is tending the lamps or fires. We may last through the night, but
                I
                doubt that the horse can: he has to carry someone tomorrow and walk again, you know. If he goes hungry
                for a
                night, he might be reduced to a skeleton. You people sit here, while old Hog goes to graze the
                horse."</em></p>
        <p>Hastily, Idiot untied the reins and pulled the horse outside. <em>"Sha Monk,"</em> said Pilgrim, <em>"you
                stay here and
                keep Master company. I'll follow him and see where he is going to graze the horse."</em></p>
        <p><em>"Wukong,"</em> said Tripitaka, <em>"you may go and see where he's going, but don't ridicule him."</em>
            <em>"I know,"</em> said
            Pilgrim. The Great Sage walked out of the main hall, and with one shake of his body he changed into a red
            dragonfly. He flew out of the front gate and caught up with Eight Rules.
        </p>
        <p>Idiot pulled the horse out to where there was grass, but he did not graze him there. Shouting and whooping,
            he chased the horse instead to the rear of the house, where he found the woman standing outside the door
            with three girls, enjoying the sight of some chrysanthemums. When mother and daughters saw Eight Rules
            approaching, the three girls slipped inside the house at once, but the woman stood still beside the door and
            said, <em>"little elder, where are you going?"</em> Our Idiot threw away the reins and went up to greet her
            with a
            most friendly <em>"Hello!"</em></p>
        <p>Then he said, <em>"Mama, I came to graze the horse."</em> <em>"Your master is much too squeamish,"</em> said
            the woman. <em>"If he
                took a wife in our family, he would be much better off, wouldn't he, than being a mendicant trudging to
                the
                West?"</em> <em>"Well, they all have received the command of the Tang emperor,"</em> said Eight Rules,
            with a laugh, <em>"and
                they haven't the courage to disobey the ruler's decree. That's why they are unwilling to do this thing.
                Just
                now they were all trying to play tricks on me in the front hall, and I was somewhat embarrassed because
                I
                was afraid that Mama would find my long snout and large ears too offensive."</em> <em>"I don't,
                really."</em> said the
            woman. <em>"And since we have no master of the house, it's better to take one than none at all. But I do
                fear
                that my daughters may find you somewhat unattractive."</em> <em>"Mama,"</em> said Eight Rules,
            <em>"please instruct your noble
                daughters not to choose their men that way. Others may be more handsome, but they usually turn out to be
                quite useless. Though I may be ugly, I do live by certain principles."</em> <em>"And what are
                they?"</em> asked the woman.
            Eight Rules replied,
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Though I may be somewhat ugly,</li>
            <li>I can work quite diligently.</li>
            <li>A thousand acres of land, you say?</li>
            <li>No need for oxen to plow it.</li>
            <li>I'll go over it once with my rake,</li>
            <li>And the seeds will grow in season.</li>
            <li>When there's no rain I can make rain.</li>
            <li>When there's no wind I'll call for wind.</li>
            <li>If the house is not tall enough,</li>
            <li>I'll build you a few stories more.</li>
            <li>If the grounds are not swept I'll give them a sweep.</li>
            <li>If the gutter's not drained I'll draw it for you.</li>
            <li>All things both great and small around the house</li>
            <li>I am able to do most readily.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>"If you can work around the house,"</em> said the woman, <em>"you should discuss the matter again with
                your master. If
                there's no great inconvenience, we'll take you."</em> <em>"No need for further discussion,"</em> said
            Eight Rules, <em>"for
                he's no genuine parent of mine. Whether I want to do this or not is for me to decide."</em> <em>"All
                right, all
                right,"</em> said the woman. <em>"Let me talk to my girls first."</em> She slipped back inside
            immediately and slammed the
            rear door shut. Eight Rules did not graze the horse there either, but led it back to the front. Little did
            he realize, however, that Great Sage Sun had heard everything. With wings outstretched, the Great Sage flew
            back to see the Tang Monk, changing back into his original form. <em>"Master,"</em> he said, <em>"Wuneng is
                leading the
                horse back here."</em> <em>"Of course he's leading the horse,"</em> said the Tang Monk, <em>"for if he
                doesn't, it may run
                away in a fit of mischief."</em> Pilgrim started to laugh and gave a thorough account of what the woman
            and Eight
            Rules had said, but Tripitaka did not know whether to believe him or not.</p>
        <p>In a little while Idiot arrived and tied up the horse. <em>"Have you grazed him?"</em> asked the elder.
            <em>"There's not
                much good grass around here,"</em> said Eight Rules, <em>"so it's really no place to graze a
                horse."</em> <em>"It may not be a
                place to graze the horse,"</em> said Pilgrim, <em>"but is it a place to lead a horse?"</em> When Idiot
            heard this
            question, he knew that his secret was known. He lowered his head and turned it to one side; with pouting
            lips and wrinkled brows, he remained silent for a long time. Just then, they heard the side door open with a
            creak, and out came a pair of red lanterns and a pair of portable incense burners. There were swirling
            clouds of fragrance and the sounds of tinkling girdle-jade when the woman walked out leading her three
            daughters. Zhenzhen, Aiai, and Lianlian were told to bow to the scripture pilgrims, and as they did so,
            standing in a row at the main hall, they appeared to be most beautiful indeed. Look at them!
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each mothlike eyebrow painted halcyon-blue:</li>
            <li>Each pretty face aglow with springlike hues.</li>
            <li>What beguiling, empire-shaking beauty!</li>
            <li>What ravishing, heart-jolting charm!</li>
            <li>Their filigreed headgears enhance their grace;</li>
            <li>Silk sashes afloat, they seem wholly divine.</li>
            <li>Like ripe cherries their lips part, half-smiling,</li>
            <li>As they walk slowly and spread their orchid-scent.</li>
            <li>Their heads full of pearls and jade</li>
            <li>Atop countless hairpins slightly trembling.</li>
            <li>Their bodies full of delicate aroma,</li>
            <li>Shrouded by exquisite robes of fine golden thread.</li>
            <li>Why speak of lovely ladies of the South,</li>
            <li>Or the good looks of Xizi?</li>
            <li>They look like the fairy ladies descending from the Ninefold Heaven,</li>
            <li>Or the Princess Change leaving her Vast Cold Palace.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When he saw them, Tripitaka lowered his head and folded his hands in front of him, while the Great Sage
            became mute and Sha Monk turned away completely. But look at that Zhu Eight Rules! With eyes unblinking, a
            mind filled with lust, and passion fast rising, he murmured huskily, <em>"What an honor it is to have the
                presence of you immortal ladies! Mama, please ask these dear sisters to leave."</em> The three girls
            went behind
            the screen, leaving the pair of lanterns behind.</p>
        <p>The woman said, <em>"Have you four elders made up your mind which one of you shall be betrothed to my
                daughters?"</em>
            <em>"We have discussed the matter,"</em> said Wujing, <em>"and we have decided that the one whose surname is
                Zhu shall
                enter your family."</em> <em>"Brother,"</em> said Eight Rules, <em>"please don't play any tricks on me.
                Let's discuss the
                matter further."</em> <em>"What's there to discuss?"</em> said Pilgrim. <em>"You have already made all
                the arrangements with
                her at the back door, and even call her „Mama.' What's there to discuss anymore? Master can be the
                in-law
                for the groom while this woman here will give away the bride; old Monkey will be the witness, and Sha
                Monk
                the go-between. There's no need even to consult the almanac, for today happens to be the most auspicious
                and
                lucky day. You come here and bow to Master, and then you can go inside and become her son-in-law."</em>
            <em>"Nothing
                doing! Nothing doing!"</em> said Eight Rules. <em>"How can I engage in this kind of business?"</em>
            <em>"Idiot!"</em> said Pilgrim.
            <em>"Stop this fakery! You have addressed her as „Mama' for countless times already! What do you mean by
                „nothing doing'? Agree to this at once, so that we may have the pleasure of enjoying some wine at the
                wedding."</em> He caught hold of Eight Rules with one hand and pulled at the woman with the other,
            saying,
            <em>"Mother-in-law, take your son-in-law inside."</em> Somewhat hesitantly, Idiot started to shuffle inside,
            while
            the woman gave instructions to a houseboy, saying, <em>"Take out some tables and chairs and wipe them clean.
                Prepare a vegetarian dinner to serve these three relatives of ours. I'm leading our new master
                inside."</em> She
            further gave instructions for the cook to begin preparation for a wedding banquet to be held the next
            morning. The houseboys then left to tell the cook. After the three pilgrims had eaten their meal, they
            retired to the guest rooms, and we shall say no more of them for the moment.
        </p>

        <h2>We now tell you about Eight Rules, who followed his mother-in-law and walked inside.</h2>
        <p>There were row upon row of doorways and chambers with tall thresholds, causing him constantly to stumble and
            fall. <em>"Mama,"</em> said Idiot, <em>"please walk more slowly. I'm not familiar with the way here, so you
                must guide me
                a little."</em></p>
        <p>The woman said, <em>"These are all the storerooms, the treasuries, the rooms where the flour is ground. We
                have
                yet to reach the kitchen."</em></p>
        <p><em>"What a huge house!"</em> said Eight Rules. Stumbling along a winding course, he walked for a long time
            before
            finally reaching the inner chamber of the house.</p>
        <p><em>"Son-in-law,"</em> said the woman, <em>"since your brother said that today is a most auspicious and lucky
                day, I have
                taken you in. In all this hurry, we have not had the chance of consulting an astrologer, nor have we
                been
                prepared for the proper wedding ceremony of worshiping Heaven and Earth and of spreading grains and
                fruits
                on the bridal bed. Right now, why don't you kowtow eight times toward the sky?"</em></p>
        <p><em>"You are right, Mama,"</em> said Eight Rules. <em>"You take the upper seat also, and let me bow to you a
                few times.
                We'll consider that my worship of Heaven and Earth as well as my gesture of gratitude to you. Doing
                these
                two things at once will save me some trouble."</em></p>
        <p><em>"All right, all right,"</em> said his mother-in-law, laughing. <em>"You are indeed a son-in-law who knows
                how to
                fulfill your household duties with the least effort. I'll sit down, and you can make your bows."</em>
        </p>
        <p>The candles on silver candlesticks were shining brightly throughout the hall as Idiot made his bows.
            Afterwards he said, <em>"Mama, which one of the dear sisters do you plan to give me?"</em></p>
        <p><em>"That's my dilemma,"</em> said his mother-in-law. <em>"I was going to give you my eldest daughter, but I
                was afraid of
                offending my second daughter. I was going to give you my second daughter, but I was afraid then of
                offending
                my third daughter. And if I were to give you my third daughter, I fear that my eldest daughter may be
                offended. That's why I cannot make up my mind."</em></p>
        <p><em>"Mama,"</em> said Eight Rules, <em>"if you want to prevent strife, why not give them all to me? That way,
                you will
                spare yourself a lot of bickering that can destroy the harmony of the family."</em></p>
        <p><em>"Nonsense!"</em> said his mother-in-law. <em>"You mean you alone want to take all three of my
                daughters?"</em></p>
        <p><em>"Listen to what you're saying, Mama!"</em> said Eight Rules. <em>"Who doesn't have three or four
                concubines nowadays?
                Even if you have a few more daughters, I'll gladly take them all. When I was young, I learned how to be
                long-lasting in the arts of love. You can be assured that I'll render satisfactory service to every one
                of
                them."</em></p>
        <p><em>"That's no good! That's no good!"</em> said the woman. <em>"I have a large handkerchief here, with which
                you can cover
                your head, blindfold yourself, and determine your fated marriage that way. I'm going to ask my daughters
                to
                walk past you, and the one you can catch with your hands will be betrothed to you."</em> Idiot accepted
            her
            suggestion and covered his head with his handkerchief. We have a testimonial poem that says:</p>
        <p>The fool knows not the true causes of things;<br>
            Beauty's sword can in secret wound the self.<br>
            The Duke of Zhou of old had fixed the rites.<br>
            But a bridegroom today still veils his head!</p>
        <p>After Idiot had tied himself up properly, he said, <em>"Mama, ask the dear sisters to come out."</em></p>
        <p><em>"Zhenzhen, Aiai, Lianlian,"</em> cried his mother-in-law, <em>"you all come out and determine your fated
                marriage, so
                that one of you may be given to this man."</em> With the sounds of girdle-jade and the fragrance of
            orchids, it
            seemed that some immortal ladies had suddenly appeared. Idiot indeed stretched forth his hands to try to
            catch hold of one of the girls, but though he darted about madly this way and that, he could not lay hands
            on anyone on either side of him. It seemed to him, to be sure, that the girls were making all kinds of
            movement around him, but he could not grab a single one of them. He lunged toward the east and wrapped his
            arms around a pillar; he made a dive toward the west and slammed into a wooden partition. Growing faint from
            rushing about like that, he began to stumble and fall all over the place —tripping on the threshold in front
            of him, smashing into the brick wall behind him! Fumbling and tumbling around, he ended up sitting on the
            floor with a bruised head and a swollen mouth.</p>
        <p><em>"Mama,"</em> he cried, panting heavily, <em>"you have a bunch of slippery daughters! I can't catch a
                single one of
                them! What am I to do? What am I to do?"</em></p>
        <p>Taking off his blindfold, the woman said, <em>"Son-in-law, it's not that my daughters are slippery; it's just
                that they are all very modest. Each defers to the other so that she may take you."</em></p>
        <p><em>"If they are unwilling to take me, Mama,"</em> said Eight Rules, <em>"why don't you take me
                instead?"</em></p>
        <p><em>"Dear son-in-law,"</em> said the woman, <em>"you really have no regard for age or youth, when you even
                want your
                mother-in-law! My three daughters are really quite talented, for each one of them has woven a silk
                undershirt studded with pearls. Try them on, and the one whose shirt fits you will take you in."</em>
        </p>
        <p><em>"Fine! Fine! Fine!"</em> said Eight Rules. <em>"Bring out all three undershirts and let me try them on.
                If all fit me,
                they can all have me."</em></p>
        <p>The woman went inside and took out one undershirt, which she handed over to Eight Rules. Taking off his blue
            silk shirt, Idiot took up the undergarment and draped it over his body at once. Before he had managed to tie
            the strings, however, he suddenly fell to the floor. The undershirt, you see, had changed into several
            pieces of rope which had him tightly bound. As he lay there in unbearable pain, the women vanished.</p>
        <h2>We now tell you about Tripitaka, Pilgrim, and Sha Monk, who woke up when it began to grow light in the East.
        </h2>
        <p>As they opened their eyes, they discovered that all the noble halls and buildings had vanished. There were
            neither carved beams nor gilded pillars, for the truth of the matter was that they had all been sleeping in
            a forest of pines and cedars. In a panic, the elder began to shout for Pilgrim, and Sha Monk also cried,
            <em>"Elder Brother, we are finished! We have met some ghosts!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>The Great Sage Sun, however, realized fully what had happened. Smiling gently, he said, <em>"What are you
                talking
                about?"</em></p>
        <p><em>"Look where we've been sleeping!"</em> cried the elder.</p>
        <p><em>"It's pleasant enough in this pine forest,"</em> said Pilgrim, <em>"but I wonder where that Idiot is
                going through his
                ordeal."</em></p>
        <p><em>"Who is going through an ordeal?"</em> asked the elder.</p>
        <p>Pilgrim answered with a laugh. <em>"The women of that household happened to be some bodhisattvas from
                somewhere,
                who had waited for us to teach us a lesson. They must have left during the night, but unfortunately Zhu
                Eight Rules has to suffer."</em> When Tripitaka heard this, he quickly folded his hands to make a bow.
            Then they
            saw a slip of paper hanging on an old cedar tree, fluttering in the wind. Sha Monk quickly took it down for
            his master to read. On it was written the following eight-line poem:</p>
        <p>Though the old Dame of Li Shan had no desire,<br>
            Guanyin invited her to leave the mount.<br>
            Mañjuśri and Viśvabhadra, too, were guests<br>
            Who took in the woods the form of maidens fair.<br>
            The holy monk's virtuous and truly chaste,<br>
            But Eight Rules's profane, loving things mundane.<br>
            Henceforth he must repent with quiet heart,<br>
            For if he's slothful, the way will be hard.</p>
        <p>As the elder, Pilgrim, and Sha Monk recited this poem aloud, they heard a loud call from deep in the woods:
        </p>
        <p><em>"Master, the ropes are killing me! Save me, please! I'll never dare do this again!"</em></p>
        <p><em>"Wukong,"</em> said Tripitaka, <em>"is it Wuneng who is calling us?"</em></p>
        <p><em>"Yes,"</em> said Sha Monk. <em>"Brother,"</em> said Pilgrim, <em>"don't bother about him. Let us leave
                now."</em></p>
        <p><em>"Though Idiot is stupid and mischievous,"</em> said Tripitaka, <em>"he is at least fairly honest, and he
                has arms
                strong enough to carry the luggage. Let's have some regard for the Bodhisattva's earlier intention,
                let's
                rescue him so that he may continue to follow us. I doubt that he'll ever dare do this again."</em> Sha
            Monk
            thereupon rolled up the bedding and put the luggage in order, after which Great Sage Sun untied the horse to
            lead the Tang Monk into the woods to see what had happened. Ah! So it is that</p>
        <p>You must take care in the pursuit of truth<br>
            To purge desires, and you'll enter the Real.</p>
        <p>We do not know what sort of good or evil was in store for the Idiot; let's listen to the explanation in the
            next chapter.</p>
