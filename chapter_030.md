THIRTY
A deviant demon attacks the true Dharma
The Horse of the Will recalls Mind Monkey
We were telling you about the fiend who, having had Sha Monk firmly bound,
did not proceed to kill him or beat him. He did not, in fact, utter so much as an abusive
word to his prisoner. Holding on to his scimitar, he thought to himself instead, “The
Tang Monk is a man from a noble nation, who must know the meaning of propriety and
righteousness. How could he possibly send his disciples to try to seize me, when it was I
who spared his life in the first place? Aha! It has to be some sort of letter sent by that
wife of mine back to her kingdom, and that‟s how the news is leaked! Let me go ask
her.”
Turning savage all of a sudden, the monster wanted to kill the princess.
The princess, alas, was still in the dark about the whole matter. After putting on
her makeup, she was walking along when she saw the fiend approaching with bulging
eyes and knitted brows, fiercely grinding his teeth together. Smiling broadly, she said to
him, “Husband, what‟s bothering you so terribly?”
“You filthy bitch!” cried the fiend. “You don‟t have any regard for human
relations! When I first brought you here, you didn‟t utter half a word of protest. You had
silk to wear and gold to put on; whatever you needed I went out to procure. You have
been enjoying the goods of all four seasons and my deep affection every day. Why do
you still think only of your parents, with no care at all for our marriage?” When the
princess heard what he said, she was so terror-stricken that she knelt on the ground at
once. “Husband,” she said, “why are you speaking such words of separation today?”
“I don‟t know whether it‟s you or I who wants separation!” said the fiend. “I
caught the Tang Monk and wanted very much to enjoy him. Why did you promise him
release before you even consulted me? The fact of the matter had to be that you wrote a
letter in secret and asked him to deliver it for you. If it weren‟t so, why did those two
monks come fighting back to my door and demand your return? Didn‟t you do all this?”
“Husband, you wrong me,” said the princess. “Since when did I send any
letter?”
“Still trying to deny it, huh?” said the fiend. “I‟ve caught someone here who‟s
going to be a witness.”
“Who‟s he?” asked the princess. The old fiend said, “Sha Monk, the second
disciple of the Tang Monk.” Now, no human person is likely to accept death willingly
even if death is near. Determined to deny everything, the princess said, “Husband, calm
yourself and let us go question him. If there were a letter, I would gladly let you beat me
to death. But if there were no such letter, wouldn‟t you have slain me unjustly?” When
the fiend heard these words, he did not wait for further discussion. Stretching forth his
indigo hand that had the size and shape of a winnow, he grabbed the princess by those
ten thousand locks of long, lovely hair and pulled her all the way to the front. He threw
her to the ground and then went forward, scimitar in hand, to question the prisoner.
“Sha Monk,” he bellowed, “since the two of you dared fight up to our door, I ask
you this: was it because this girl had sent a letter back to her country that the king told
you to come?” When the shackled Sha Monk saw how furious the monster was, hurling
385
385
the princess to the ground and threatening to kill her with the scimitar, he thought to
himself, “Of course she sent a letter. But she also saved my master, and that was an
incomparably great favor. If I admitted it freely, he would kill the princess on the spot
and that would have meant our repaying kindness with enmity. All right! All right! Old
Sand, after all, has followed Master all this time and I haven‟t made the merest of merit.
Today, I‟m already a bound captive here; I might as well offer my life to repay my
master‟s kindness.”
He then shouted, “Monster, don‟t you dare be unruly! What kind of letter did she
send that made you want to accuse her and take her life? There was another reason for
us to come to demand from you the princess. Because you had imprisoned my master in
the cave, he had the chance to catch a glimpse of the princess, her looks and her
gestures. By the time we reached the Precious Image Kingdom and had our travel
rescript certified, the king was making all kinds of inquiry about the whereabouts of his
daughter with a painted portrait of hers. He showed my master that portrait and asked us
whether we had seen her on the way. When my master described the lady he saw at this
place, the king knew it was his daughter. He bestowed on us his own imperial wine and
commanded us to come here to take you captive and bring his princess back to the
palace. This is the truth. Since when was there a letter? If you want to kill someone, you
can kill old Sand! But don‟t harm an innocent bystander and add to your sins!” When
the fiend heard how heroically Sha Monk had spoken, he threw away his scimitar and
lifted the princess up with both his hands, saying, “I was quite rough with you just now,
and I must have offended you deeply. Please forgive me!”
He helped her straighten her hair again and reset the bejeweled ornaments with
great tenderness and amiability, hugging her and teasing her as they walked inside. He
then asked her to take a seat in the middle of the chamber and apologized again. The
princess, after all, was a rather fickle woman; when she saw how penitent he became,
she, too, had a change of heart. “Husband,” she said, “if you have regard for our love,
please loosen those ropes on Sha Monk a little.” When the old fiend heard that, he
ordered the little ones to untie Sha Monk and lock him up instead. After he was freed
and locked up, Sha Monk stood up, secretly pleased and thinking to himself, “The
ancients said, „Kindness to others is really kindness to oneself.‟ If I were not kind to her,
she wouldn‟t make him untie me, would she?”
The old fiend, meanwhile, asked also for wine and food to be served as a means
of making further amends to the princess and calming her fears. After drinking until
they were half tipsy, the old fiend suddenly changed into a brightly colored robe and
girded a sword on his waist. “Mistress,” he said, caressing the princess with his hand,
“you stay home and drink some more. Look after our two kids and don‟t let Sha Monk
get away. While the Tang Monk is still in the kingdom, I‟m going there to get
acquainted with my kin.”
“To get acquainted with what kin?” asked the princess. “Your Father King,” said
the old fiend. “I‟m his imperial son-in-law and he‟s my father-in-law. Why shouldn‟t I
go and get acquainted?”
The princess said, “You can‟t go.”
“Why not?” said the old fiend. The princess said, “My Father King did not win
his empire by might on horseback; he inherited it from his ancestors. Since he ascended
his throne in his youth, he hasn‟t even left the gate of the city. We have no violent men
with looks so savage and gruesome as yours. If you meet him, you might scare him and
that wouldn‟t be a good thing. It‟s better that you not go to get acquainted.”
386
386
“If you put it like that,” said the old fiend, “let me change into a handsome
fellow and go there.”
“Change and let me look at you first,” said the princess.
Dear monster! Right before the dining table, he shook his body once and
changed into a very comely person. Truly he had
Most elegant features
And a rugged physique.
He spoke like a mandarin
And moved with the grace of youth.
Gifted as Zijian he could rhyme with ease;
He looked like Pan An when they tossed him fruits.
He put on his head a crow-tail cap,
His hair gathered in smoothly;
And wore on his body a lined, white silk robe
With wide, billowy sleeves.
Beneath his feet were patterned black boots;
Around his waist shone the five-colored belt.
He had the true bearing of a striking man:
Handsome, tall, dignified, and full of strength.
The princess was most pleased by what she saw. “Mistress,” said that fiend
laughing, “is it a good transformation?”
“Marvelous! Marvelous!” said the princess. “Just remember this: once you enter
the court, many officials, both civil and military, will no doubt invite you to banquets,
since it‟s my Father King‟s policy never to reject any relatives. You must be extra
careful when you drink not to reveal your original appearance. For once you show
yourself in your true form, you don‟t look that civilized.”
“No need for all that instruction,” said the old fiend. “I know what to do.” Look
at him. He mounted the clouds and soon arrived at the Precious Image Kingdom.
Lowering their direction, he went before the court and said to the guardian of the gate,
“The third imperial son-in-law came especially to seek an audience with the Throne.
Please report this for me.”
The Custodian of the Yellow Gate went before the white jade steps and made the
report, saying, “Your Majesty, the third imperial son-in-law has come to seek an
audience with the Throne. He is outside the gate of the court and awaits your
summons.”
The king was just conversing with the Tang Monk; when he heard of the third
imperial son-in-law, he asked his ministers, “We have only two sons-in-law. How is it
that there is a third?”
“The third imperial son-in-law,” said several of the ministers, “must be that
monster.”
“Shall we summon him in?” asked the king. Already apprehensive, the elder
said, “Your Majesty, it‟s a monster-spirit! If he‟s not a spirit, he will not be intelligent.
He must know the future and the past, for he is able to mount the clouds and ride the
mists. He‟ll come when you summon him, but even if you did not, he would come in
387
387
anyway. You might as well summon him in so that we might be spared any kind of
hassle.”
The king gave his consent and ordered the fiend be summoned before the golden
steps. He, too, went through an elaborate performance of court ritual to pay homage to
the king. When all the officials saw how handsome he was, they dared not consider him
a monster-spirit; being of fleshly eyes and mortal stock, they regarded him as a good
man instead. When the king saw how lofty and dignified he appeared, he also thought
that this was a man of distinguished abilities, fit to govern the world. “Son-in-law,” he
said, “where is your home? What region are you from? When did you marry our
princess? Why did you wait until today before coming to be recognized as our kin?”
“My lord,” said the old fiend, kowtowing, “your subject comes from a
household east of this city, in the Current-Moon Cave of the Casserole Mountain.”
The king asked, “How far is your mountain from our place?”
“Not far,” replied the old fiend, “only about three hundred miles.”
“Three hundred miles,” said the king. “How could our princess possibly get
there to marry you?” With clever words and the intent to deceive, the monster-spirit
replied, “My lord, your subject has been fond of archery and riding since his youth, for I
earn my livelihood by hunting. Thirteen years ago, I led scores of houseboys up to the
mountain, and we were just sending out our hawks and hounds when we saw a large,
striped tiger. It was going down the slope of the mountain carrying a young girl. It was
your subject who shot the tiger with a single arrow and brought the girl back to our
village, where she was revived with some warm liquids. When I questioned her about
her home after saving her life, she never mentioned the word „princess.‟ Had she
declared that she was the third princess of your Majesty, would I dare be so insolent as
to marry her without your consent? I would have tried to enter the golden palace and
seek some kind of appointment, however lowly, in order to be worthy of her. Because
she claimed, however, that she was a girl from some peasant household, your subject
asked her to remain in my village. We seemed to be ideally suited for each other, and
we were both willing; that‟s why we‟ve been married for these thirteen years. After our
wedding, I was about to slaughter the tiger and use it to fete the relatives. The princess,
however, requested me not to do so, and she put her reason aptly in these poetic lines:
Heaven and Earth made us husband and wife;
With no broker or witness we were wed.
Red threads did bind our feet in previous lives:
That‟s why the tiger is our go-between.
Because of what she said, your subject untied the tiger and spared its life. Claws
flailing and tail wagging, it ran away still carrying the arrow wound. Little did I
anticipate that after a few years, the tiger thus spared managed to become a spirit in the
mountain through self-cultivation, bent on seducing and hurting people. Some years
ago, your subject had heard of several scripture pilgrims, all priests sent by the Great
Tang. The tiger, I think, must have taken their lives; he probably got hold of the travel
documents and changed into one of their forms to come here to deceive my lord. My
lord, the person sitting on that brocaded cushion over there is none other than the tiger
which carried away the princess thirteen years ago. He is not a real scripture pilgrim.”
Look at that capricious ruler! His foolish, undiscerning eyes of the flesh could not
recognize the monster-spirit; instead, he regarded that entire specious speech to be the
388
388
truth. “Worthy son-in-law,” he said, “how could you tell that this monk is a tiger, the
one which carried away our princess?”
“My lord,” said the fiend, “what your subject feeds on in the mountain are tigers;
what he wears are also tigers. I sleep with them and rise with them. How could I not
recognize them?”
“In that case,” said the king, “make him appear in his true form.”
The fiendish creature said, “Please give me half a cup of clean water, and your
subject will make him appear in his true form.”
The king ordered an official to fetch the water for the imperial son-in-law.
Taking the cup in his hand, the fiend got up and went forward to exercise the Dim-Eyes,
Still-Body Magic. He recited a spell and spat a mouthful of water on the Tang Monk,
crying, “Change!”
The true body of the elder at once became invisible; what everyone saw in the
palace was a ferocious striped tiger instead.
In those worldly eyes of the king and his subjects, the tiger truly had
A white brow and a round head,
A striped body and lightning eyes.
Its four huge paws
Were straight and rugged;
Its twenty claws
Were hooklike and sharp.
Sawlike teeth filled its mouth;
Pointed ears joined its eyebrows.
Savage, it bore the form of a big cat;
Raging, it had the shape of a brown steer.
Steel hairs stood rigidly like silver strips;
A red tongue, daggerlike, belched nasty air.
It was indeed a striped, ferocious thing,
Blasting the palace with its awesome breaths.
When the king saw it, his soul melted and his spirit fled, while many of his
subjects were frightened into hiding. A few courageous military officials led the
captains and guards to rush forward and began hacking away with their weapons. If it
had not been for the fact that the Tang Monk this time was not yet fated to die, even
twenty monks would have been reduced to minced meat. Fortunately, he had at this time
the secret protection of Light and Darkness, the Guardians, the Sentinels, and the
Protectors of the Faith in the air. For that reason, the weapons of those people could not
harm him. The chaos in the palace lasted until evening, when the officials decided to
capture the tiger alive and lock it up with chains before placing it in an iron cage. It was
then stored in one of the palace chambers.
The king then gave the decree that the Court of Imperial Entertainments prepare
a huge banquet to thank the imperial son-in-law for saving him from the monk. After
the officials retired from court, the demon entered that evening into the Silver Peace
Hall, where eighteen young palace ladies attended him; they sang, danced, and poured
his wine for him. Sitting all by himself at the head table, he had on both sides of him all
those lovely beauties. Look at him drink and enjoy! By about the hour of the second
watch, he got drunk and could no longer refrain from mischief. Leaping up all of a
389
389
sudden, he laughed hysterically for a moment and changed back into his original form.
He grew violent then and grabbed one of the girls playing the pipa with that big
winnowlike hand of his. With a crunch, he bit off her head. The other seventeen palace
girls were so terrified that they dashed madly for hiding and shelter. Look at them:
The palace ladies panicked;
The maids-of-honor took fright—
The palace ladies panicked
Like rain-struck hibiscus bearing the night rain.
The maids-of-honor took fright
Like wind-blown peonia dancing in the spring wind.
They smashed their pipas, eager to live;
They broke their zithers, fleeing for life.
They dashed out the doors, not knowing north or south!
They quit the main hall, flying both east and west!
They scraped their jadelike features;
They bruised their lovely faces.
Every one scrambled for her life;
Each person darted for safety.
Those people ran out, but they dared not even scream or holler for fear of
disturbing the Throne so late at night. Quaking and shaking, they sought to hide beneath
the eaves of the low palace wall and we shall speak no more of them.
We tell you now about that fiendish creature who sat in the hall, pouring wine
and drinking all by himself. After draining a glass, he would haul the bloody corpse
near him and take a couple of bites. As he was thus enjoying himself inside, the people
outside the palace began to spread a wild rumor that the Tang Monk was a monsterspirit. All the hubbub soon reached the Golden Lodge posthouse.
At that time, there was no one at the post-house except the white horse, which
was consuming hay and feed in the stall. He was originally the dragon prince of the
Western Ocean, you recall, but because of past offense against Heaven, his horns were
sawed off and his scales were shorn. He was changed into the white horse so that he
could carry the Tang Monk to acquire scriptures in the West.
When he suddenly heard people saying that the Tang Monk was a tiger spirit, he
thought to himself, “My master is definitely a true man. It had to be that fiend who
changed him into a tiger spirit in order to harm him. What‟s to be done? What‟s to be
done? Big Brother is long gone, and there is no news from either Sha Monk or Eight
Rules.”
He waited until it was about the second watch, and then he said to himself, “If I
don‟t try to rescue the Tang Monk now, this merit will be undone. Finished!” No longer
able to contain himself, he bit through the reins and shook off the saddle; all at once he
changed himself once more into a dragon and mounted the dark clouds to rise into the
air. We have a testimonial poem for him, and the poem says:
The priest goes West to seek the World- Honored One,
Though foul and fiendish vapors clog the way.
Tonight he‟s a tiger, what hopeless ordeal!
The white horse drops reins his master to save.
390

In midair the young dragon prince saw that the Silver Peace Hall was aglow with
lights, for there were eight huge candelabra standing inside with all their candles lit. As
he lowered the direction of his clouds, he looked carefully and saw the monster seated
alone at the head table and gorging himself with wine and human flesh. “What a
worthless fellow!” said the dragon with a laugh. “He has shown his hand! He‟s revealed
himself! It‟s not very smart, is it, to eat people! Since I don‟t know the where-abouts of
Master and I have only this lawless demon before me, I might as well go down there
and have some fun with him. If I succeed, I might be able to catch the monster-spirit
first and then rescue my master.”
Dear dragon prince! With one shake of his body, he changed himself into a
palace maid, truly slender of body and seductive in appearance. She walked swiftly
inside and bowed to the demon, saying, “Imperial son-in-law, please don‟t hurt me. I
came to pour wine for you.”
“Pour then,” said the fiend. Taking up the wine pot, the little dragon began
pouring until the wine was about half an inch higher than the rim of the goblet, but the
wine did not spill. This was, in fact, the Magic of Water Restriction used by the little
dragon, though the fiend did not know it even when he saw it. “What uncanny ability
you have,” he said, highly pleased. The little dragon said, “I can pour and make it go
even higher.”
“Pour some more! Pour some more!” cried the fiend. The little dragon took the
pot and kept on pouring, until the wine rose like a pagoda of thirteen layers with a
pointed top; not a drop of it was spilled. The fiendish creature stuck out his mouth and
finished a whole goblet before he picked up the carcass and took another bite. Then he
said, “You know how to sing?”
“A little,” said the little dragon, who selected a tune and sang it before
presenting another goblet of wine to the fiend. “You know how to dance?” said the
monster. The little dragon said, “A little also, but I‟m empty-handed, and the dance
won‟t be attractive.” Lifting up his robe, the fiend unbuckled the sword he wore on his
waist and pulled the blade out of the sheath.
The little dragon took the sword from him and began to dance in front of the
dining table; wielding the sword up and down, left and right, she created intricate
patterns of movement.
Waiting until the fiend was completely dazzled by the dance, the little dragon
suddenly broke the steps and slashed him with the sword. Dear monster! He lunged
sideways and the blow barely missed him; the next thrust of the dragon was met by a
candelabrum made of wrought iron and weighing about eighty or ninety pounds, which
the monster picked up in a hurry. The two of them left the Silver Peace Palace as the
little dragon changed back to his original form to do battle with the fiend in midair. This
battle in the darkness was something! “How was it?” you ask.
This one was a monster born and formed on Casserole Mount;
That one was a chastised true dragon of the Western Ocean.
This one gave off bright light
Like white lightning;
That one belched out potent air
Like bursting red cloud.
This one seemed a white-tusked elephant let loose among mankind;
That one seemed a golden-clawed wild cat flown down to earth.
391
391
This one was a jade pillar propping up Heaven;
That one was a golden beam bridging the seas.
The silver dragon flew and danced;
The yellow demon flipped and flopped.
The precious sword, left and right, did not slow down;
The candelabrum, back and forth, went on and on.
After the two of them had fought at the edge of the clouds for about eight or nine
rounds, the little dragon‟s hand grew weak and his limbs turned numb. The old demon,
after all, was strong and powerful; when the little dragon found that he could no longer
withstand his adversary, he aimed the sword at the monster and threw it at him. The
monster, however, was not unprepared for this desperate move; with one hand, he
caught the blade, and with the other, he hurled the candelabrum at the little dragon.
Unnerved, the dragon did not duck fast enough and one of his hind legs was struck by it.
Hastily he dropped down from the clouds, and it was his luck that the imperial moat was
there to save his life. Chased by the demon, the little dragon dove headfirst into the
water and all at once became invisible. Whereupon the demon took the sword and
picked up the candelabrum to go back to the Silver Peace Palace; there he drank as
before till he fell asleep, and we shall speak no more of him for the moment.
We tell you instead about the little dragon, who hid himself at the bottom of the
moat. When he did not hear a sound after half an hour, he gritted his teeth to endure the
pain in his leg and leaped up. Treading the dark clouds, he returned to the post-house
where he changed once more into a horse and lay down in the stall. He looked pitiful
indeed—completely soaked and wounded on his leg! At this time,
Horse of the Will and Ape of the Mind are all dispersed;
Metal Squire and Wood Mother are both scattered;
Yellow Dame is wounded, from every one divorced;
With reason and right so parted, what can be achieved?
Let us say no more about how Tripitaka met disaster and the little dragon
encountered defeat. We tell you instead about that Zhu Eight Rules, who, since
abandoning Sha Monk, stuck his head deep into the bushes and lay there like a hog
snoozing in a pool of mud. The nap, in fact, lasted till the middle of the night, and only
at that time did he awake. When he became conscious, he did not even know where he
was at first; only after he rubbed his eyes and collected his thoughts a little did he
manage to cock his ears to listen to whatever might be happening. Well, what happened
was that
This deep mountain had no dog barking;
These spacious wilds lacked even cock crowing.
Looking up at the stars, he figured that it was about the hour of the third watch
and he thought to himself, “I would like to try to rescue Sha Monk, but
One silk fiber is no thread;
A single hand cannot clap!
Okay! Okay! Let me go back and see Master first. If I could persuade the king to
give me some more help, old Hog would return to rescue Sha Monk tomorrow.” Idiot
mounted the clouds quickly and went back to the city; in a little while, he reached the
post-house. The moon was bright and people had become quiet at this time, but he
searched the corridors in vain to find any trace of his master. All he saw was the white
horse lying there: his whole body was soaked and on one of his hind legs was the mark
392
392
of a bruise about the size of a pan. “This is doubly unfortunate!” said Eight Rules,
greatly startled. “This loser hasn‟t traveled. Why is he sweating like that, and with a
bruise on his leg? It must be that some evil men have robbed our master, wounding the
horse in the process.”
The white horse recognized that it was Eight Rules; assuming human speech
suddenly, he called out:
“Elder Brother!” Idiot was so shaken that he fell on the ground. Pulling himself
up, he was about to dash outside when the white horse caught hold of the monk‟s robe
by his teeth, saying again, “Elder Brother, don‟t be afraid of me.”
“Brother,” said Eight Rules, still shaking, “why are you talking today? When
you talk like that, it has to mean that some great misfortune is about to befall us.”
The little dragon said, “Did you know that Master had landed in a terrible
ordeal?”
“No, I didn‟t,” said Eight Rules.
The little dragon said, “Of course, you didn‟t! You and Sha Monk were
flaunting your abilities before the king, thinking that you could capture the demon and
be rewarded for your merit. You didn‟t expect that the demon was so powerful and you
were the ones no doubt who were beaten. At least one of you could have returned to
give us the news, but there was not one word from either of you.
That monster-spirit had changed himself into a handsome scholar and broken
into the court to present himself to the king as an imperial relative. Our master was
changed by him into a ferocious striped tiger, who was then taken captive by the
officials and locked up in an iron cage in one of the palace chambers. When I heard how
Master suffered, my heart felt as if it had been stabbed by a sword.
But you were gone for nearly two days, and I was afraid that any further delay
might mean that Master would be killed. So I had no choice but to change back into my
dragon body to go and try to rescue him. When I reached the court, I couldn‟t find
Master, but I met the monster in the Silver Peace Palace. I changed into the form of a
palace maid, trying to deceive him. He asked me to do a sword dance, during which I
tried to slash him. He escaped my blow and defeated me instead with a candelabrum. I
tried desperately to hit him when I threw the sword at him, but he caught it instead and
gave me a blow on my hind leg with that candelabrum. I dived into the imperial moat
and saved my life; the bruise on my leg was caused by the candelabrum.” When Eight
Rules heard these words, he said, “Is that all true?”
“You think I‟m deceiving you?” said the little dragon. Eight Rules asked, “What
are we going to do? What are we going to do? Can you move at all?”
“If I can,” said the little dragon, “what then?”
“If you can move at all,” said Eight Rules, “move into the ocean then. Old Hog
will pole the luggage back to the Old Gao Village to pick up my wife again.” When the
little dragon heard this, he clamped his mouth onto Eight Rules‟s shirt and refused to let
go. As tears fell from his eyes, he said, “Elder Brother, you mustn‟t become indolent.”
“Why not?” said Eight Rules. “Brother Sha has already been caught by him, and
I can‟t beat him. If we don‟t scatter now, what are we waiting for?”
393
393
The little dragon thought for some time before he spoke again, tears streaming
down his cheeks. “Elder Brother, don‟t mention the word scatter. If you want to save
Master, you have to go and ask a person to come here.”
“Who is that?” asked Eight Rules. The little dragon said, “You‟d better hurry
and mount the clouds to go to the Flower-Fruit Mountain, so that you can invite our Big
Brother, Pilgrim Sun, to come back. Most certainly he has dharma power great enough
to subdue this fiend and rescue Master, avenging at the same time the shame of our
defeat.”
“Brother,” said Eight Rules, “let me go ask someone else. That monkey and I are
not on the best of terms, you know. When he killed that Lady White Bone back there on
the White Tiger Ridge, he was mad at me already for wheedling Master into reciting the
Tight- Fillet Spell. I was just being frivolous, and I didn‟t think that the old priest would
really recite it and even banish him. I don‟t know how he hates me now, and I‟m certain
also that he won‟t come back. Suppose we have a little argument then: that funeral staff
of his is pretty heavy, you know. If he doesn‟t know any better at that moment and gives
me a few strokes, you think I‟ll be able to live?”
The little dragon said, “He won‟t hit you, because he is a kind and just Monkey
King. When you see him, don‟t say that Master is in peril; just tell him that Master is
thinking of him and deceive him into coming. When he gets here and sees what‟s
happening, he will not get mad. He will want most certainly to have it out with the
monster-spirit instead. Then the demon will surely be caught and Master will be saved.”
“All right, all right!” said Eight Rules. “You are so dedicated. If I don‟t go, it‟ll
mean that I‟m not dedicated. I‟ll go, and if indeed Pilgrim consents to come, I‟ll return
with him. But if he is unwilling, then don‟t expect me, because I won‟t be coming back
either.”
“Go! Go!” said the little dragon. “He will certainly come.” Idiot indeed put away
his muckrake and straightened his shirt. He leaped up and mounted the clouds, heading
straight toward the East. It so happened that the Tang Monk was not yet fated to die.
The wind was blowing in the right direction; all Idiot had to do was to stick up his huge
ears, and he sped across the Eastern Ocean as if sails were hoisted on him. The sun was
just rising when he dropped from the clouds to find his way in the mountain. As he was
walking, he heard someone talking. He took another careful look and found Pilgrim
sitting on a huge boulder in a mountain valley. Before him some one thousand and two
hundred monkeys lined up in ranks, all shouting, “Long live our Father Great Sage!”
Eight Rules said, “What pleasures! What pleasures! No wonder he doesn‟t want
to be a monk and wants only to come home! Look at all these goodies! Such a huge
household, and so many little monkeys to serve him! If old Hog has a large farm like
this, I‟m not going to be a monk either. Since I‟ve arrived, what shall I do? I suppose
I‟ll have to see him.”
But Idiot was in truth afraid of Pilgrim, and he dared not show himself openly.
Sliding down the grassy meadow, he crawled stealthily into the midst of those
thousand-odd monkeys and began to kowtow also along with them. He had no idea how
high the Great Sage was sitting and how sharp his vision was. Having seen everything
all at once, the Monkey King asked, “Who is that barbarian in the ranks who‟s bowing
in such a confused manner? Where does he come from? Bring him up here!”
Hardly had he finished speaking when the little monkeys, like a swarm of bees,
pushed Eight Rules to the front and pressed him to the ground.

Pilgrim said, “Barbarian, where did you come from?”
“I dare not accept the honor of your questioning me,” said Eight Rules, his head
lowered. “I‟m no barbarian, I‟m an acquaintance.” Pilgrim said, “All the monkeys under
the command of the Great Sage here have similar features, not like that lubberly face of
yours.
You must be some fiendish demon from another region. If so, and if you want to
be a subject of mine, you should have first presented us with your name and the
particulars of your age and antecedents on a card so that I can take your roll when you
are assigned to our ranks here. But you haven‟t even done that, and you dare kneel here
to bow to me?” With his head and snout lowered, Eight Rules said, “Oh, for shame! I‟ll
show you my face! I have been a brother of yours now for a few years, and you still
claim that you don‟t recognize me, calling me some kind of barbarian!”
“Raise your head and let me have a look,” said Pilgrim with a chuckle. Sticking
his snout upward, Idiot said, “Look! Even if you can‟t recognize me, you can at least
recognize this snout of mine!” Pilgrim could not refrain from laughing and saying, “Zhu
Eight Rules.”
As soon as he heard this, he jumped up, crying, “Yes! Yes! I am Zhu Eight
Rules.”
He thought to himself also, “If he recognizes me, then it‟s easier to speak.”
Pilgrim said, “Why aren‟t you accompanying the Tang Monk to go fetch scriptures?
Why are you here? Could it be that you, too, have offended Master and he banished you
also? Do you have any letter of banishment? Let me see it.”
“I didn‟t offend him,” said Eight Rules, “and he didn‟t give me any letter of
banishment. Nor did he dismiss me.”
“If there‟s no letter and he didn‟t dismiss you, why are you here?” asked
Pilgrim. Eight Rules replied, “Master has been thinking of you; he told me to come and
invite you to go back.”
“He didn‟t think of me, nor did he invite me,” said Pilgrim. “He swore to
Heaven that day and he wrote the letter of banishment himself. How could he think of
me and ask me to go back? I definitely will not go back.”
Eight Rules lied conveniently, saying, “He really did think of you! He really did
think of you!”
“What made him think of me?” asked Pilgrim. Eight Rules said, “As Master was
riding on the horse, he called out at one point, „Disciple.‟ I didn‟t hear him, and Sha
Monk claimed that he was somewhat deaf! Master at once thought of you, saying that
we were worthless and that only you were smart and alert enough to answer once you
were called, to give ten replies to one question. That‟s how he thought of you, and he
has sent me specially to ask you to go back. Please do so, at least for the sake of his
expectation and for the sake of my having traveled all this distance.” When Pilgrim
heard these words, he jumped down from the boulder. Taking the hand of Eight Rules,
he said, “Worthy Brother, sorry that you have to travel such a great distance to come.
Let‟s you and I go and have some fun.”
“Elder Brother,” said Eight Rules, “this place is quite far away, and I fear that
Master might be kept waiting. I don‟t want to play.” Pilgrim said, “After all, this is your
395

first time here. Take a look at least at my mountain scenery.” Idiot dared not persist in
his refusal and had to walk away with him.
The two of them proceeded hand in hand, while the little monsters followed
behind to go up to the highest spot on the Flower-Fruit Mountain. Marvelous mountain!
Ever since the Great Sage‟s homecoming, it had been completely made new by his labor
these few days. You see the mountain
Green as carved jade,
Tall like a cloud-scraper.
All around are tigers crouched and dragons coiled;
On four sides are frequent calls of apes and cranes.
At dawn the clouds blockade the summit;
At dusk the sun is poised above the forest.
The flowing stream murmurs like tingling girdle-jade;
The brook sounds drop by drop a psaltery note.
Before the mountain are ridges and tall cliffs;
Behind the mountain are flowers and dense woods.
It touches the jade-girl‟s hair-washing bowl above;
It joins a branch of Heaven‟s River down below.
This cosmos-formed beauty surpasses Penglai,
A true cave-mansion born of primal breaths.
Even master artists find it hard to sketch,
Nor can wise immortals depict it all.
Like openworks carved finely fantastic rocks
In fantastic colors soar up at the top.
The sun moves in a thousand purple rays;
Auspicious air forms countless strands of red mist.
A cave-heaven, a blessed place among mankind:
A mountain full of fresh blossoms and fresh trees.
Delighted by the endless splendor of the scenery, Eight Rules said, “Elder
Brother, what a lovely place! Truly the number one mountain in the whole world!”
“Worthy Brother,” said Pilgrim, “think you can pass the time here?”
“Look at the way Elder Brother talks!” chuckled Eight Rules. “This precious
mountain is a cave-heaven, a land of blessing. How could you say „pass the time‟?”
The two of them chatted amiably for a long time before descending from the
peak. They met on the way several little monkeys, all holding purple grapes, fragrant
pears, bright golden loquats, and dark red strawberries. Kneeling by the road, they cried,
“Father Great Sage, please have some breakfast.”
“My Brother Zhu,” said Pilgrim, laughing, “has a huge appetite, and he doesn‟t
take fruits for breakfast.
Nonetheless, please don‟t be offended by such trifles; use them as snacks and
take a few.”
Eight Rules said, “Though I have a huge appetite, I do as the natives do
anywhere. Yes, by all means bring them up here. I‟ll try a few for taste.”

The two of them ate the fruits, and the sun was fast rising high. Afraid that there
might not be enough time to save the Tang Monk, Idiot tried to urge his companion to
leave, saying, “Elder Brother, Master is waiting for us. Please hurry and go.”
“Worthy Brother,” said Pilgrim, “I‟m inviting you to have some fun with me at
the Water-Curtain Cave.”
Eight Rules at once declined, saying, “I appreciate your kind thoughts, Old
Brother, but Master has waited for a long time already. There‟s really no need for us to
enter the cave.”
“In that case,” said Pilgrim, “I dare not detain you. I‟ll say good-bye right here.”
“Elder Brother,” said Eight Rules, “aren‟t you going with me?” Pilgrim said,
“Go where? This place of mine is neither governed by Heaven nor controlled by Earth.
I‟m completely free here. Why shouldn‟t I enjoy this? Why should I become a monk
again? I will not go. You have to go back by yourself. And please tell the Tang Monk
that once he has dismissed me, don‟t ever think of me again.” When Idiot heard these
words, he dared not press any further, for he was afraid that Pilgrim‟s temper might
flare and he would then receive a couple of strokes from the rod. He had no alternative
but to take leave meekly and find his way back.
When Pilgrim saw him leave, he ordered two agile little monkeys to follow him
and to find out what he was going to say. Indeed, when that Idiot descended the
mountain, he did not cover more than three or four miles before he turned around and
pointed his finger at the direction of Pilgrim. “You ape,” he cried, “you don‟t want to be
a priest! You choose to be a monster instead. What an ape! I came here with good
intentions to ask him to go back, but he refused. All right! If you don‟t want to go, you
don‟t have to!”
He took a few steps and began his castigations again. The two little monkeys ran
back to report, “Father Great Sage, that Zhu Eight Rules is rather sneaky! He‟s ranting
at you as he walks away.” Pilgrim grew angry and shouted, “Seize him!”
All the little monkeys rushed after Eight Rules and pushed him to the ground.
Clutching at his mane and tugging at his ears, pulling his tail and grabbing his hair, they
hauled him bodily back to the cave. We do not know how he will be treated or what will
happen to him; let‟s listen to the explanation in the next chapter.
