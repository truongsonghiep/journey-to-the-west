We were telling you about the disciple and master, who urged the horse forward
        and arrived at the front gate of the building. They saw that it was indeed a monastery
        with
        Tiers of towers and turrets,
        And rows of quiet chambers.
        Above the temple gate
        Hung the august panoply of colored nimbus;
        Before the Hall of Five Blessings
        Whirled a thousand strands of bright red mists.
        Two rows of pines and bamboos;
        One grove of juniper and cypress;
        Two rows of pines and bamboos
        Revealed their fair virtue unspoiled by time;
        One grove of juniper and cypress
        Displayed its chaste beauty in comely hues.
        They saw also the tall bell tower,
        The pagoda rugged,
        Monks in silent meditation
        And birds on trees gently cooing.
        A dustless seclusion was the real seclusion,
        For the quiescence of Dao was truly quiescent.
        The poem says:
        This temple, like Jetavana, hides in a jade-green grove.
        Its beauty surpasses even the Ṣaḍ-varṣa.
        Pure land among mankind is rare indeed:
        This world‟s famed mountains are mostly held by monks.
        The priest dismounted, and Pilgrim laid down his load. They were about to walk
        through the gate when a monk came out. “How does he look?” you ask.
        He wore a hat pinned to the left
        And a robe most spotlessly pure.
        Two brass rings hung from his ears;
        A silk sash was wrapped round his waist.
        His straw sandals moved sedately;
        His hands carried a wooden fish.
        His mouth recited constantly
        The Wisdom he sought most humbly.
        When Tripitaka saw him, he stood waiting by the gate and saluted with his
        palms pressed together in front of him. The monk returned the greeting at once and said
        laughing, “I‟m sorry, but I don‟t know you!”
        He then asked, “Where do you come from? Please come in for some tea.”
        212
        212
        “Your disciple,” said Tripitaka, “has been sent by royal decree from the Land of
        the East to go to seek scriptures from Buddha in the Temple of Thunderclap. It was
        getting late when we arrived here, and we would like to ask for a night‟s lodging in your
        fair temple.”
        “Please take a seat inside,” said the monk. Only then did Tripitaka call Pilgrim
        to lead the horse inside. When the monk caught sight of Pilgrim‟s face, he became
        somewhat afraid and asked, “What‟s that thing leading the horse?”
        “Speak softly!” said Tripitaka. “He‟s easily provoked! If he hears you referring
        to him as a thing, he‟ll get mad. He happens to be my disciple.” With a shiver, the monk
        bit his finger and said, “Such a hideous creature, and you made him your disciple!”
        Tripitaka said, “You can‟t tell by mere appearance. He may be ugly, but he is
        very useful.”
        That monk had little choice but to accompany Tripitaka and Pilgrim as they
        entered the temple gate. Inside, above the main hall‟s entrance, the words “Guanyin
        Chan Hall” were written in large letters. Highly pleased, Tripitaka said, “This disciple
        has repeatedly benefited from the holy grace of the Bodhisattva, though he has had no
        opportunity to thank her. Now that we are at this Chan hall, it is as if we are meeting the
        Bodhisattva personally, and it is most proper that I should offer my thanks.” When the
        monk heard this, he told one of the attendants to open wide the door of the hall and
        invited Tripitaka to worship. Pilgrim tied up the horse, dropped his luggage, and went
        with Tripitaka up the hall. Stretching his back and then flattening himself on the ground,
        Tripitaka kowtowed to the golden image as the monk went to beat the drum, and
        Pilgrim began to strike the bell. Prostrating himself before the seat of the deity,
        Tripitaka poured out his heart in prayer. When he finished, the monk stopped the drum,
        but Pilgrim continued to strike the bell without ceasing.
        Now rapidly, now slowly, he persisted for a long time. The attendant said, “The
        service is over. Why are you still striking the bell?” Only then did Pilgrim throw away
        the hammer and say, laughing, “You wouldn‟t know this! I‟m just living by the proverb:
        „If you are a monk for a day, strike then the bell for a day!‟”
        By then, the monks young and old of the monastery and the elders of upper and
        lower chambers were all aroused by the unruly sound of the bell. They rushed out
        together crying, “Who is the maniac fooling with the bell?” Pilgrim leaped out of the
        hall and shouted, “Your Grandpa Sun sounded it to amuse himself!”
        The moment the monks saw him, they were so frightened that they tumbled and
        rolled on the ground. Crawling around, they said, “Father Thunder!”
        “He‟s only my great-grandson!” said Pilgrim. “Get up, get up! Don‟t be afraid.
        We are noble priests who have come from the Great Tang Nation in the east.”
        The various monks then bowed courteously to him, and when they saw
        Tripitaka, they were even more reassured. One of the monks, who was the abbot of the
        monastery, said, “Let the holy fathers come to the living room in the back so that we
        may offer them some tea.” Untying the reins and leading the horse, they picked up the
        luggage and went past the main hall to the back of the monastery, where they sat down
        in orderly rows.
        213
        213
        After serving tea, the abbot prepared a vegetarian meal, although it was still
        rather early for dinner. Tripitaka had not finished thanking him when an old monk
        emerged from the rear, supported by two boys. Look how he was attired:
        He wore on his head a Vairocana hat
        Topped by a precious, shining cat‟s-eye stone;
        He wore on his body a brocaded woolen frock,
        Piped brilliantly in gold and kingfisher feathers.
        A pair of monk shoes on which Eight Treasures were set,
        And a priestly staff encased with starry gems.
        His face full of wrinkles,
        He looked like the Old Witch of Li Mountain;
        His eyes were dim-sighted,
        Though he seemed a Dragon King of the Eastern Ocean.
        Wind stabbed his mouth for his teeth had fallen,
        And palsy had made crooked his aged back.
        The various monks made the announcement:
        “The Patriarch is here.”
        Tripitaka bowed to receive him, saying, “Old Abbot, your disciple bows to you.”
        The old monk returned the gesture, and they were both seated. “Just now I heard
        the little ones announcing,” said the old monk, “that venerable fathers from the Tang
        court have arrived from the east. I came out specifically to meet you.”
        “Without knowing any better,” said Tripitaka, “we intruded into your esteemed
        temple. Please pardon us!”
        “Please, please!” said the old monk. “May I ask the holy father what the distance
        is between here and the Land of the East?”
        “Since leaving the outskirts of Chang‟an,” said Tripitaka, “I traveled for some
        five thousand miles before passing the Mountain of Two Frontiers, where I picked up a
        little disciple. Moving on, we passed through the Hamil Kingdom of the western
        barbarians, and in two months we had traveled another five or six thousand miles. Only
        then did we arrive at your noble region.”
        “Well, you have covered the distance of ten thousand miles,” said the old monk.
        “This disciple truly has spent his life in vain, for he has not even left the door of the
        temple. I have, as the saying goes, „sat in the well to look at the sky.‟ A veritable piece
        of dead wood!”
        Then Tripitaka asked, “What is the honorable age of the Old Abbot?”
        “Foolishly I have reached my two hundred and seventieth year,” said the old
        monk. When Pilgrim heard this, he said, “You are only my descendant of the tenthousandth generation!”
        “Careful!” said Tripitaka, looking at him sternly. “Don‟t offend people with
        your brashness!”
        “And you, Elder,” asked the old monk, “how old are you?”
        “I dare not tell,” said Pilgrim. That old monk thought it was just a foolish
        remark; he paid no further attention, nor did he ask again. Instead, he called for tea to be
        served, and a young cleric brought out a tray made of milk-white jade on which there
        214
        214
        were three cloisonné cups with gold edges. Another youth brought out a white copper
        pot and poured three cups of scented tea, truly more colorful than camellia buds and
        more fragrant than cassia flowers. When Tripitaka saw these, he could not cease making
        compliments, saying, “What marvelous things! What marvelous things! A lovely drink,
        indeed, and lovely utensils!”
        “Most disgraceful stuff!” said the old monk. “The holy father resides in the
        heavenly court of a great nation, and he has witnessed all kinds of rare treasures. Things
        like these are not worthy of your praise. Since you have come from a noble state, do you
        have any precious thing you can show me?”
        “It‟s pathetic!” said Tripitaka. “We have no precious thing in the Land of the
        East; and even if we had, I could not bring it with me because of the distance.”
        From the side, Pilgrim said, “Master, I saw a cassock the other day in our bag.
        Isn‟t that a treasure? Why not take it out and show it to him?” When the other monks
        heard him mentioning a cassock, they all began to snicker. “What are you laughing at?”
        asked Pilgrim.
        The abbot said, “To say that a cassock is a treasure, as you just did, is certainly
        laughable. If you want to talk about cassocks, priests like us would possess more than
        twenty or thirty such garments. Take the case of our Patriarch, who has been a monk
        here for some two hundred and fifty years. He has over seven hundred of them!”
        He then made the suggestion:
        “Why not take them out for these people to see?”
        That old monk certainly thought it was his show this time! He asked the
        attendants to open up the storage room and the dhūtas to bring out the chests. They
        brought out twelve of them and set them down in the courtyard. The padlocks were
        unlocked; clothes racks were set up on both sides, and ropes were strung all around.
        One by one, the cassocks were shaken loose and hung up for Tripitaka to see. It was
        truly a roomful of embroidery, four walls of exquisite silk! Glancing at them one by
        one, Pilgrim saw that they were all pieces of fine silk intricately woven and delicately
        embroidered, splashed with gold. He laughed and said, “Fine! Fine! Fine! Now pack
        them up! Let‟s take ours out for you to look at.” Pulling Pilgrim aside, Tripitaka said
        softly, “Disciple, don‟t start a contest of wealth with other people. You and I are
        strangers away from home, and this may be a mistake!”
        “Just a look at the cassock,” said Pilgrim, “how can that be a mistake?”
        “You haven‟t considered this,” said Tripitaka. “As the ancients declared, „The
        rare object of art should not be exposed to the covetous and deceitful person.‟ For once
        he sees it, he will be tempted; and once he is tempted, he will plot and scheme. If you
        are timid, you may end up yielding to his every demand; otherwise, injury and loss of
        life may result, and that‟s no small matter.”
        “Relax! Relax!” said Pilgrim. “Old Monkey will assume all responsibility!”
        Look at him! He did not permit any further discussion! Darting away, he untied the bag,
        and brilliant rays at once came flashing through the two layers of oil-paper in which the
        garment was wrapped. He discarded the paper and took out the cassock. As he shook it
        loose, a crimson light flooded the room and glorious air filled the courtyard. When the
        various monks saw it, none could suppress the admiration in his heart and the praise on
        his lips. It was truly a magnificent cassock! It has hanging on it
        Sparkling pearls—marvelous in every way—
        215
        215
        And Buddha‟s treasures in each aspect rare.
        Up and down spreads grapevine weave on gorgeous silk;
        On every side are hems of fine brocade.
        Put it on, and goblins will then be slain.
        Step in it, and demons will flee to Hell.
        It‟s made by those hands of gods incarnate;
        He who‟s not a true monk dares not wear it.
        When the old monk saw a treasure of such quality, he was indeed moved to
        villainy. Walking forward, he knelt down before Tripitaka, and tears began to fall from
        his eyes. “This disciple truly has no luck,” he said. “Old Abbot,” said Tripitaka, raising
        him up, “what do you mean?”
