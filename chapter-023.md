TWENTY-THREE
# Tripitaka does not forget his origin <br> The Four Sages test the priestly mind

*A long journey westward is his decree,<br>
As frosted blooms fall in autumn's mild breeze.<br>
Tie up the sly ape, don't loosen the ropes!<br>
Hold back the mean horse, and don't use the whip!<br>
Wood Mother was once fused with Metal Squire;<br>
Yellow Dame and Naked Son never did differ.<br>
Bite open the iron ball—there's mystery true:<br>
Perfection of wisdom will come to you.*

The principal aim of this chapter is to make clear that the way to acquire scriptures is no different from the way of attending to the fundamentals in one's life. We now tell you about master and disciples, the four of them, who, having awakened to the suchness of all things, broke free from the fetters of dust. Leaping clear from the sea of nature's flowing sand, they were completely rid of any hindrance and proceeded westward on the main road. They passed through countless green hills and blue waters; they saw wild grass and untended flowers in endless arrays. Time was swift indeed and soon it was autumn again. You see

*Maple leaves redden the mountain;<br>
Yellow blooms endure the night-wind.<br>
Old cicada's song turns languid;<br>
Sad crickets ever voice their plaint.<br>
Cracked lotus leaves like green silk fans;<br>
Fragrant oranges like gold balls.<br>
Lovely, those rows of wild geese,<br>
In dots they spread to distant sky.*

As they journeyed, it was getting late again. *"Disciples,"* said Tripitaka, *"it's getting late. Where shall we go to spend the night?"*

*"Master,"* said Pilgrim, *"what you said is not quite right. Those who have left home dine on the winds and rest beside the waters; they sleep beneath the moon and lie on the frost; in short, any place can be their home. Why ask where we should spend the night?"*

*"Elder Brother,"* said Zhu Eight Rules, *"all you seem to care about is making progress on the journey, and you've no concern for the burdens of others. Since crossing the Flowing-Sand River, we have been doing nothing but scaling mountains and peaks, and hauling this heavy load is becoming rather hard on me. Wouldn't it be much more reasonable to look for a house where we can ask for some tea and rice, and try to regain our strength?"*

*"Idiot,"* said Pilgrim, *"your words sound as if you begrudge this whole enterprise. If you think that you are still back in the Gao Village, where you can enjoy
the comfort that comes to you without your exerting yourself, then you won't make it! If you have truly embraced the faith of Buddhism, you must be willing to endure pain and suffering; only then will you be a true disciple."*

*"Elder Brother,"* said Eight Rules, *"how heavy do you think this load of luggage is?"* Pilgrim said, *"Brother, since you and Sha Monk joined us, I haven't had a chance to pole it. How would I know its weight?"*

*"Ah! Elder Brother,"* said Eight Rules, just count the things here:

*Four yellow rattan mats;
Long and short, eight ropes in all.
To guard against dampness and rain,
There are blankets—three, four layers!
The flat pole's too slippery, perhaps?
You add nails on nails at both ends!
Cast in iron and copper, the nine-ringed priestly staff.
Made of bamboo and rattan, the long, large cloak.
With all this luggage, you should pity old Hog, who has to walk all day carrying
it! You only are the disciple of our master:
I've been made into a long-term laborer!"*

*"Idiot!"* said Pilgrim with a laugh, *"to whom are you protesting?"*

*"To you, Elder Brother,"* said Eight Rules. *"If you're protesting to me,"* said Pilgrim, *"you've made a mistake! Old Monkey is solely concerned with Master's safety, whereas you and Sha Monk have the special responsibility of looking after the luggage and the horse. If you ever slack off, you'll get a good whipping in the shanks from this huge rod!"*

*"Elder Brother,"* said Eight Rules, *"don't mention whipping, for that only means taking advantage of others by brute force. I realize that you have a proud and haughty nature, and you are not about to pole the luggage. But look how fat and strong the horse is that Master is riding: he's only carrying one old monk. Make him take a few pieces of luggage, for the sake of fraternal sentiment!"*

*"So you think he's a horse!"* said Pilgrim. *"He's no earthly horse, for he is originally the son of Aorun, the Dragon King of the Western Ocean. Because he set fire
to the palace and destroyed some of its pearls, his father charged him with disobedience and he was condemned by Heaven. He was fortunate to have the Bodhisattva Guanyin save his life, and he was placed in the Eagle Grief Stream to await Master's arrival. At the appropriate time, the Bodhisattva also appeared personally to take off his scales and horns and to remove the pearls around his neck. It was then that he changed into this horse to carry Master to worship Buddha in the Western Heaven. This is a matter of achieving merit for each one of us individually, and you shouldn't bother him."*

When Sha Monk heard these words, he asked, *"Elder Brother, is he really a dragon?"*

*"Yes,"* replied Pilgrim. Eight Rules said, *"Elder Brother, I have heard an ancient saying that a dragon can breathe out clouds and mists, kick up dust and dirt, and he even has the ability to leap over mountains and peaks, the divine power to stir up rivers and seas. How is it that he is walking so slowly at the moment?"*

*"You want him to move swiftly?"* said Pilgrim. *"I'll make him do that. Look!"*

Dear Great Sage! He shook his goldenhooped rod once, and there were ten thousand shafts of colorful lights! When that horse saw the rod, he was so afraid that he
might be struck by it that he moved his four legs like lightning and darted away. As his hands were weak, the master could not restrain the horse from this display of its mean nature. The horse ran all the way up a mountain cliff before slowing down to a trot. The master finally caught his breath, and that was when he discovered in the distance several stately buildings beneath some pine trees. He saw

*Doors draped by hanging cedars:
Houses beside a green hill;
Pine trees fresh and straight.
And some poles of mottled bamboo.
By the fence wild chrysanthemums glow with the frost:
By the bridge orchid reflections redden the stream.
Walls of white plaster;
And fences brick-laid.
A great hall, how noble and august:
A tall house, so peaceful and clean.
No oxen or sheep are seen, nor hens or dogs.
After autumn's harvest farm chores must be light.*

As the master held on to the saddle and slowly surveyed the scenery, Wukong and his brothers arrived. *"Master,"* said Wukong, *"you didn't fall off the horse?"*

*"You brazen ape!"* scolded the elder. *"You were the one who frightened the horse! It's a good thing I managed to stay on him!"*

Attempting to placate him with a smile, Pilgrim said, *"Master, please don't scold me. It all began when Zhu Eight Rules said that the horse was moving too slowly: so I made him hurry a little."*

Because he tried to catch up with the horse, Idiot ran till he was all out of breath, mumbling to himself, *"I'm done, done! Look at this belly of mine, and the slack torso! Already the pole is so heavy that I can hardly carry it. Now I'm given the additional bustle and toil of running after this horse!"*

*"Disciples,"* said the elder, *"look over there. There's a small village where we may perhaps ask for lodging."*

When Pilgrim heard these words, he looked up and saw that it was covered by auspicious clouds and hallowed mists. He knew then that this place had to be a creation of buddhas or immortals, but he dared not reveal the Heavenly secret. He only said, *"Fine! Fine! Let's go ask for shelter."*

Quickly dismounting, the elder discovered that the towered entrance gate was decorated with carved lotus designs and looped slits in the woodwork; its pillars were carved and its beams gilded. Sha Monk put down the luggage, while Eight Rules led the horse, saying, *"This must be a family of considerable wealth!"*

Pilgrim would have gone in at once, but Tripitaka said, *"No, you and I are priests, and we should behave with circumspection. Don't ever enter a house without permission. Let's wait until someone comes out, and then we may request lodging politely."*

Eight Rules tied up the horse and sat down, leaning against the wall. Tripitaka sat on one of the stone drums while Pilgrim and Sha Monk seated themselves at the foot
of the gate. They waited for a long time, but no one came out. Impatient by nature, Pilgrim leaped up after a while and ran inside the gate to have a look. There were, in fact, three large halls facing south, each with its curtains drawn up highly. Above the door screen hung a horizontal scroll painting with motifs of long life and rich blessings. And pasted on the gold lacquered pillars on either side was this new year couplet written on bright red paper:

Frail willows float like gossamer, the low bridge at dusk:
Snow dots the fragrant plums, a small yard in the spring.
In the center hall, there was a small black lacquered table, its luster half gone,
bearing an old bronze urn in the shape of a beast. There were six straight-backed chairs
in the main hall, while hanging screens were mounted on the walls east and west just below the roof.

As Pilgrim was glancing at all this furtively, the sound of footsteps suddenly came from behind the door to the rear, and out walked a middle-aged woman who asked
in a seductive voice, *"Who are you, that you dare enter a widow's home without permission?"*

The Great Sage was so taken aback that he could only murmur his reply: *"This humble monk came from the Great Tang in the Land of the East, having received the royal decree to seek scriptures from Buddha in the West. There are four of us altogether. As we reached your noble region, it became late, and we therefore approached the sacred abode of the old Bodhisattva to seek shelter for the night."*

Smiling amiably, the woman said, *"Elder, where are your other three companions? Please invite them to come in."*

*"Master,"* shouted Pilgrim in a loud voice, *"you are invited to come in."* Only then did Tripitaka enter with Eight Rules and Sha Monk, who was leading the horse and carrying the luggage as well. The woman walked out of the hall to greet them, where she was met by the furtive, wanton glances of Eight Rules. *"How did she look?"* you ask.

*She wore a gown of mandarin green and silk brocade,
Topped by a light pink vest,
To which was fastened a light yellow embroidered skirt;
Her high-heeled, patterned shoes glinted beneath.
A black lace covered her stylish coiffure,
Nicely matching the twin-colored braids like dragons coiled.
Her ivory palace-comb, gleaming red and halcyon-blue,
Supported two gold hair-pins set aslant.
Her half-grey tresses swept up like phoenix wings;
Her dangling earrings had rows of precious pearls.
Still lovely even without powder or rouge,
She had charm and beauty like one fair youth.*

When the woman saw the three of them, she became even more amiable and invited them with great politeness into the main hall. After they had exchanged greetings one after the other, the pilgrims were told to be seated for tea to be served. From behind the screen a young maid with two tufts of flowing locks appeared, holding a golden tray with several white-jade cups. There were

*Fragrant tea wafting warm air,
Strange fruits spreading fine aroma.*

That lady rolled up her colorful sleeves and revealed long, delicate fingers like the stalks of spring onions; holding high the jade cups, she passed the tea to each one of them, bowing as she made the presentation. After the tea, she gave instructions for vegetarian food to be prepared.

*"Old Bodhisattva,"* said Tripitaka bowing, *"what is your noble surname? And what is the name of your esteemed region?"*

The woman said, *"This belongs to the West Aparagodānīya Continent. My maiden surname is Jia (Unreal), and the surname of my husband's family is Mo (Nonexisting). Unfortunately, my in-laws died prematurely, and my husband and I inherited our ancestral fortune, which amounted to more than ten thousand taels of silver and over fifteen thousand acres of prime land. It was fated, however, that we
should have no son, having given birth only to three daughters. The year before last, it was my great misfortune to lose my husband also, and I was left a widow. This year my mourning period is completed, but we have no other relatives beside mother and
daughters to inherit our vast property and land. I would have liked to marry again, but I find it difficult to give up such wealth. We are delighted, therefore, that the four of you have arrived, for we four, mother and daughters, would like very much to ask you to
become our spouses. I do not know what you will think of this proposal."*

When Tripitaka heard these words, he turned deaf and dumb; shutting his eyes to quiet his mind, he fell silent and gave no reply. The woman said, *"We own over three hundred acres of paddies, over four hundred and sixty acres of dried fields, and over four hundred and sixty acres of orchards and forests. We have over a thousand head of yellow water buffalo, herds of mules and horses, countless pigs and sheep. In all four quarters, there are over seventy barns and haystacks. In this household there is grain enough to feed you for more than eight or nine years, silk that you could not wear out in a decade, gold and silver that you might spend for a lifetime. What could be more delightful than our silk sheets and curtains, which can render spring eternal? Not to mention those who wear golden hairpins standing in rows! If all of you, master and disciples, are willing to change your minds and enter the family of your wives, you will be most comfortable, having all these riches to enjoy. Will that not be better than the toil of the journey to the West?"* 

Like a mute and stupid person, Tripitaka refused to utter a word. The woman said, *"I was born in the hour of the Cock, on the third day of the third month, in the year Dinghai. As my deceased husband was three years my senior, I am now forty-five years old. My eldest daughter, named Zhenzhen, is twenty; my second daughter, Aiai, is eighteen; and my youngest daughter, Lianlian, is sixteen. None of them has been betrothed to anyone. Though I am rather homely, my daughters fortunately are rather good-looking. Moreover, each of them is well trained in needlework and the feminine arts. And because we had no son, my late husband brought them up as if they were boys, teaching them some of the Confucian classics when they were young as well as the art of writing verse and couplets. So, although they reside in a mountain home, they are not vulgar or uncouth persons; they would make suitable matches, I dare say, for all of you. If you elders can put away your inhibitions and let your hair grow again, you can at once become masters of this household. Are not the
silk and brocade that you will wear infinitely better than the porcelain almsbowl and black robes, the straw sandals and grass hats?"* 

Sitting aloft in the seat of honor, Tripitaka was like a child struck by lightning, a frog smitten by rain. With eyes bulging and rolling upward, he could barely keep himself from keeling over in his chair. But Eight Rules, hearing of such wealth and such beauty, could hardly quell the unbearable itch in his heart! Sitting on his chair, he kept turning and twisting as if a needle were pricking him in the ass.

Finally he could restrain himself no longer. Walking forward, he tugged at his master, saying, *"Master! How can you completely ignore what the lady has been saying to you? You must try to pay some attention."*

Jerking back his head, the priest gave such a hostile shout that Eight Rules backed away hurriedly. *"You cursed beast!"* he bellowed. *"We are people who have left home. How can we possibly allow ourselves anymore to be moved by riches and tempted by beauty?"*

Giggling, the woman said, *"Oh dear, dear! Tell me, what's so good about those who leave home?"*

*"Lady Bodhisattva,"* said Tripitaka, *"tell me what is so good about those of you who remain at home?"*

*"Please take a seat, elder,"* said the woman, *"and let me tell you the benefits in the life of those of us who remain at home. If you ask what they are, this poem will make them abundantly clear.

*When spring fashions appear I wear new silk;
Pleased to watch summer lilies I change to lace.
Autumn brings fragrant rice-wine newly brewed.
In winter's heated rooms my face glows with wine.
I may enjoy the fruits of all four climes
And every dainty of eight seasons, too.
The silk sheets and quilts of the bridal eve
Best the mendicant's life of Buddhist chants."*
Tripitaka said, *"Lady Bodhisattva, you who remain in the home can enjoy riches
and glory; you have things to eat, clothes to wear, and children by your side. That is
undeniably a good life, but you do not know that there are some benefits in the life of
those of us who have left home. If you ask what they are, this poem will make them
abundantly clear.
The will to leave home is no common thing:
You must tear down the old stronghold of love!
No cares without, tongue and mouth are at peace;
Your body within has good yin and yang.
When merit's done, you face the Golden Arch
And go hack, mind enlightened, to your Home.
It beats the life of lust for household meat:
You rot with age, one stinking bag of flesh!"*

When the woman heard these words, she grew terribly angry, saying, *"How dare you to be so insolent, you brazen monk! If I had had no regard for the fact that you have come from the Land of the East, I would have sent you away at once. Now, I was trying to ask you, with all sincerity, to enter our family and share our wealth, and you insult me instead. Even though you have received the commandments and made the vow never to return to secular life, at least one of your followers could become a member of our family. Why are you being so legalistic?"*

Seeing how angry she had become, Tripitaka was intimidated and said, *"Wukong, why don't you stay here."* Pilgrim said, *"I've been completely ignorant in such matters since the time I was young. Let Eight Rules stay."*

*"Elder Brother,"* said Eight Rules, *"don't play tricks on people. Let's all have some further discussion."*

*"If neither of you is willing,"* said Tripitaka, *"I'll ask Wujing to stay."*

*"Listen to the way Master is speaking!"* said Sha Monk. *"Since I was converted by the Bodhisattva and received the commandments from her, I've been waiting for you. It has been scarcely two months since you took me as your disciple and gave me your teachings, and I have yet to acquire even half an inch of merit. You think I would dare seek such riches! I will journey to the Western Heaven even if it means my death! I'll never engage in such perfidious activities!"*

When the woman saw them refusing to remain, she quickly walked behind the screen and slammed the door to the rear. Master and disciples were left outside, and no one came out again to present tea or rice. Exasperated, Eight Rules began to find fault with the Tang Monk, saying, *"Master, you really don't know how to handle these matters! In fact, you have ruined all our chances by the way you spoke! You could have been more flexible and given her a vague reply so that she would at least have given us a meal. We would at least have enjoyed a pleasant evening, and whether we would be willing to stay tomorrow or not would have been for us to decide. Now the door is shut and no one is going to come out. How are we going to last through the night in the midst of these empty ashes and cold
stoves?"*

*"Second Brother,"* said Wujing, *"why don't you stay here and become her sonin-law?"*

Eight Rules said, *"Brother, don't play tricks on people. Let's discuss the matter further."*









----------------------------------------

*"What's there to discuss?"* said Pilgrim. *"If you are willing, Master and that
woman will become in-laws, and you will be the son-in-law who lives in the girl's
home. With such riches and such treasures in this family, you will no doubt be given a
huge dowry and a nice banquet to greet the kinsfolk, which all of us can also enjoy.
Your return to secular life here will in fact benefit both parties concerned."*
*"You can say that all right,"* said Eight Rules, *"but for me it's a matter of fleeing
the secular life only to return to secular life, of leaving my wife only to take another
wife."*
*"So, Second Brother already has a wife?"* said Sha Monk. *"You didn't realize,”
Pilgrim said, *"that originally he was the son-in-law of Mr. Gao of the Old Gao Village,
in the Kingdom of Qoco. Since I defeated him, and since he had earlier received the
commandments from the Bodhisattva, he had little choice but to follow the priestly
vocation. That's the reason he abandoned his former wife to follow Master and to go
worship Buddha in the Western Heaven. I suppose he has felt the separation keenly and
has been brooding on it for some time. Just now, when marriage was mentioned, he
must have been sorely tempted. Idiot, why don't you become the son-in-law of this
household? Just make sure that you make a few extra bows to old Monkey, and you
won't be reprimanded!"*
“Nonsense! Nonsense!"* said Idiot. *"Each one of us is tempted, but you only
want old Hog to be embarrassed. The proverb says, „A monk is the preta of sensuality,‟
and which one of us can truly say that he doesn't want this? But you have to put on a
show, and your histrionics have ruined a good thing. Now we can't even get a drop of
tea or water, and no one is tending the lamps or fires. We may last through the night, but
I doubt that the horse can: he has to carry someone tomorrow and walk again, you
know. If he goes hungry for a night, he might be reduced to a skeleton. You people sit
here, while old Hog goes to graze the horse."*
Hastily, Idiot untied the reins and pulled the horse outside. *"Sha Monk,"* said
Pilgrim, *"you stay here and keep Master company. I'll follow him and see where he is
going to graze the horse."*
305
305
“Wukong,"* said Tripitaka, *"you may go and see where he's going, but don't
ridicule him."*
“I know,"* said Pilgrim. The Great Sage walked out of the main hall, and with
one shake of his body he changed into a red dragonfly. He flew out of the front gate and
caught up with Eight Rules.
Idiot pulled the horse out to where there was grass, but he did not graze him
there. Shouting and whooping, he chased the horse instead to the rear of the house,
where he found the woman standing outside the door with three girls, enjoying the sight
of some chrysanthemums. When mother and daughters saw Eight Rules approaching,
the three girls slipped inside the house at once, but the woman stood still beside the door
and said, *"little elder, where are you going?"* Our Idiot threw away the reins and went
up to greet her with a most friendly *"Hello!"*
Then he said, *"Mama, I came to graze the horse."*
*"Your master is much too squeamish,"* said the woman. *"If he took a wife in our
family, he would be much better off, wouldn't he, than being a mendicant trudging to
the West?"*
“Well, they all have received the command of the Tang emperor,"* said Eight
Rules, with a laugh, *"and they haven't the courage to disobey the ruler's decree. That's
why they are unwilling to do this thing. Just now they were all trying to play tricks on
me in the front hall, and I was somewhat embarrassed because I was afraid that Mama
would find my long snout and large ears too offensive."*
“I don't, really."* said the woman. *"And since we have no master of the house,
it's better to take one than none at all. But I do fear that my daughters may find you
somewhat unattractive."*
“Mama,"* said Eight Rules, *"please instruct your noble daughters not to choose
their men that way. Others may be more handsome, but they usually turn out to be quite
useless. Though I may be ugly, I do live by certain principles."*
“And what are they?"* asked the woman. Eight Rules replied,
“Though I may be somewhat ugly,
I can work quite diligently.
A thousand acres of land, you say?
No need for oxen to plow it.
I'll go over it once with my rake,
And the seeds will grow in season.
When there's no rain I can make rain.
When there's no wind I'll call for wind.
If the house is not tall enough,
I'll build you a few stories more.
If the grounds are not swept I'll give them a sweep.
If the gutter's not drained I'll draw it for you.
All things both great and small around the house
I am able to do most readily."*
“If you can work around the house,"* said the woman, *"you should discuss the
matter again with your master. If there's no great inconvenience, we'll take you."*
“No need for further discussion,"* said Eight Rules, *"for he's no genuine parent
of mine. Whether I want to do this or not is for me to decide."*
306
306
“All right, all right,"* said the woman. *"Let me talk to my girls first."* She slipped
back inside immediately and slammed the rear door shut. Eight Rules did not graze the
horse there either, but led it back to the front. Little did he realize, however, that Great
Sage Sun had heard everything. With wings outstretched, the Great Sage flew back to
see the Tang Monk, changing back into his original form. *"Master,"* he said, *"Wuneng
is leading the horse back here."*
“Of course he's leading the horse,"* said the Tang Monk, *"for if he doesn't, it
may run away in a fit of mischief."* Pilgrim started to laugh and gave a thorough account
of what the woman and Eight Rules had said, but Tripitaka did not know whether to
believe him or not.
In a little while Idiot arrived and tied up the horse. *"Have you grazed him?"*
asked the elder. *"There's not much good grass around here,"* said Eight Rules, *"so it's
really no place to graze a horse."*
“It may not be a place to graze the horse,"* said Pilgrim, *"but is it a place to lead
a horse?"*
When Idiot heard this question, he knew that his secret was known. He lowered
his head and turned it to one side; with pouting lips and wrinkled brows, he remained
silent for a long time. Just then, they heard the side door open with a creak, and out
came a pair of red lanterns and a pair of portable incense burners. There were swirling
clouds of fragrance and the sounds of tinkling girdle-jade when the woman walked out
leading her three daughters. Zhenzhen, Aiai, and Lianlian were told to bow to the
scripture pilgrims, and as they did so, standing in a row at the main hall, they appeared
to be most beautiful indeed. Look at them!
Each mothlike eyebrow painted halcyon-blue:
Each pretty face aglow with springlike hues.
What beguiling, empire-shaking beauty!
What ravishing, heart-jolting charm!
Their filigreed headgears enhance their grace;
Silk sashes afloat, they seem wholly divine.
Like ripe cherries their lips part, half-smiling,
As they walk slowly and spread their orchid-scent.
Their heads full of pearls and jade
Atop countless hairpins slightly trembling.
Their bodies full of delicate aroma,
Shrouded by exquisite robes of fine golden thread.
Why speak of lovely ladies of the South,
Or the good looks of Xizi?
They look like the fairy ladies descending from the Ninefold Heaven,
Or the Princess Change leaving her Vast Cold Palace.
When he saw them, Tripitaka lowered his head and folded his hands in front of
him, while the Great Sage became mute and Sha Monk turned away completely. But
look at that Zhu Eight Rules! With eyes unblinking, a mind filled with lust, and passion
fast rising, he murmured huskily, *"What an honor it is to have the presence of you
immortal ladies! Mama, please ask these dear sisters to leave."*
The three girls went behind the screen, leaving the pair of lanterns behind.
307
307
The woman said, *"Have you four elders made up your mind which one of you
shall be betrothed to my daughters?"*
“We have discussed the matter,"* said Wujing, *"and we have decided that the one
whose surname is Zhu shall enter your family."*
“Brother,"* said Eight Rules, *"please don't play any tricks on me. Let's discuss
the matter further."*
“What's there to discuss?"* said Pilgrim. *"You have already made all the
arrangements with her at the back door, and even call her „Mama.‟ What's there to
discuss anymore? Master can be the in-law for the groom while this woman here will
give away the bride; old Monkey will be the witness, and Sha Monk the go-between.
There's no need even to consult the almanac, for today happens to be the most
auspicious and lucky day. You come here and bow to Master, and then you can go
inside and become her son-in-law."*
“Nothing doing! Nothing doing!"* said Eight Rules. *"How can I engage in this
kind of business?"*
“Idiot!"* said Pilgrim. *"Stop this fakery! You have addressed her as „Mama‟ for
countless times already! What do you mean by „nothing doing‟? Agree to this at once,
so that we may have the pleasure of enjoying some wine at the wedding."*
He caught hold of Eight Rules with one hand and pulled at the woman with the
other, saying, *"Mother-in-law, take your son-in-law inside."* Somewhat hesitantly, Idiot
started to shuffle inside, while the woman gave instructions to a houseboy, saying,
“Take out some tables and chairs and wipe them clean. Prepare a vegetarian dinner to
serve these three relatives of ours. I'm leading our new master inside."* She further gave
instructions for the cook to begin preparation for a wedding banquet to be held the next
morning. The houseboys then left to tell the cook. After the three pilgrims had eaten
their meal, they retired to the guest rooms, and we shall say no more of them for the
moment.
We now tell you about Eight Rules, who followed his mother-in-law and walked
inside. There were row upon row of doorways and chambers with tall thresholds,
causing him constantly to stumble and fall. *"Mama,"* said Idiot, *"please walk more
slowly. I'm not familiar with the way here, so you must guide me a little."*
The woman said, *"These are all the storerooms, the treasuries, the rooms where
the flour is ground. We have yet to reach the kitchen."*
“What a huge house!"* said Eight Rules. Stumbling along a winding course, he
walked for a long time before finally reaching the inner chamber of the house. *"Son-inlaw,"* said the woman, *"since your brother said that today is a most auspicious and lucky
day, I have taken you in. In all this hurry, we have not had the chance of consulting an
astrologer, nor have we been prepared for the proper wedding ceremony of worshiping
Heaven and Earth and of spreading grains and fruits on the bridal bed. Right now, why
don't you kowtow eight times toward the sky?"*
*"You are right, Mama,"* said Eight Rules. *"You take the upper seat also, and let
me bow to you a few times. We'll consider that my worship of Heaven and Earth as
well as my gesture of gratitude to you. Doing these two things at once will save me
some trouble."*
308
308
“All right, all right,"* said his mother-in-law, laughing. *"You are indeed a son-inlaw who knows how to fulfill your household duties with the least effort. I'll sit down,
and you can make your bows."*
The candles on silver candlesticks were shining brightly throughout the hall as
Idiot made his bows. Afterwards he said, *"Mama, which one of the dear sisters do you
plan to give me?"*
“That's my dilemma,"* said his mother-in-law. *"I was going to give you my
eldest daughter, but I was afraid of offending my second daughter. I was going to give
you my second daughter, but I was afraid then of offending my third daughter. And if I
were to give you my third daughter, I fear that my eldest daughter may be offended.
That's why I cannot make up my mind."*
“Mama,"* said Eight Rules, *"if you want to prevent strife, why not give them all
to me? That way, you will spare yourself a lot of bickering that can destroy the harmony
of the family."*
“Nonsense!"* said his mother-in-law. *"You mean you alone want to take all three
of my daughters?"*
“Listen to what you're saying, Mama!"* said Eight Rules. *"Who doesn't have
three or four concubines nowadays? Even if you have a few more daughters, I'll gladly
take them all. When I was young, I learned how to be long-lasting in the arts of love.
You can be assured that I'll render satisfactory service to every one of them."*
“That's no good! That's no good!"* said the woman. *"I have a large handkerchief
here, with which you can cover your head, blindfold yourself, and determine your fated
marriage that way. I'm going to ask my daughters to walk past you, and the one you can
catch with your hands will be betrothed to you."* Idiot accepted her suggestion and
covered his head with his handkerchief. We have a testimonial poem that says:
The fool knows not the true causes of things;
Beauty's sword can in secret wound the self.
The Duke of Zhou of old had fixed the rites.
But a bridegroom today still veils his head!
After Idiot had tied himself up properly, he said, *"Mama, ask the dear sisters to
come out."*
“Zhenzhen, Aiai, Lianlian,"* cried his mother-in-law, *"you all come out and
determine your fated marriage, so that one of you may be given to this man."* With the
sounds of girdle-jade and the fragrance of orchids, it seemed that some immortal ladies
had suddenly appeared. Idiot indeed stretched forth his hands to try to catch hold of one
of the girls, but though he darted about madly this way and that, he could not lay hands
on anyone on either side of him. It seemed to him, to be sure, that the girls were making
all kinds of movement around him, but he could not grab a single one of them. He
lunged toward the east and wrapped his arms around a pillar; he made a dive toward the
west and slammed into a wooden partition. Growing faint from rushing about like that,
he began to stumble and fall all over the place —tripping on the threshold in front of
him, smashing into the brick wall behind him! Fumbling and tumbling around, he ended
up sitting on the floor with a bruised head and a swollen mouth.
“Mama,"* he cried, panting heavily, *"you have a bunch of slippery daughters! I
can't catch a single one of them! What am I to do? What am I to do?"*

Taking off his blindfold, the woman said, *"Son-in-law, it's not that my
daughters are slippery; it's just that they are all very modest. Each defers to the other so
that she may take you."*
“If they are unwilling to take me, Mama,"* said Eight Rules, *"why don't you take
me instead?"*
“Dear son-in-law,"* said the woman, *"you really have no regard for age or youth,
when you even want your mother-in-law! My three daughters are really quite talented,
for each one of them has woven a silk undershirt studded with pearls. Try them on, and
the one whose shirt fits you will take you in."*
“Fine! Fine! Fine!"* said Eight Rules. *"Bring out all three undershirts and let me
try them on. If all fit me, they can all have me."*
The woman went inside and took out one undershirt, which she handed over to
Eight Rules. Taking off his blue silk shirt, Idiot took up the undergarment and draped it
over his body at once. Before he had managed to tie the strings, however, he suddenly
fell to the floor. The undershirt, you see, had changed into several pieces of rope which
had him tightly bound. As he lay there in unbearable pain, the women vanished.
We now tell you about Tripitaka, Pilgrim, and Sha Monk, who woke up when it
began to grow light in the East. As they opened their eyes, they discovered that all the
noble halls and buildings had vanished. There were neither carved beams nor gilded
pillars, for the truth of the matter was that they had all been sleeping in a forest of pines
and cedars. In a panic, the elder began to shout for Pilgrim, and Sha Monk also cried,
*"Elder Brother, we are finished! We have met some ghosts!"*
The Great Sage Sun, however, realized fully what had happened. Smiling gently,
he said, *"What are you talking about?"*
“Look where we've been sleeping!"* cried the elder.
“It's pleasant enough in this pine forest,"* said Pilgrim, *"but I wonder where that
Idiot is going through his ordeal."*
“Who is going through an ordeal?"* asked the elder.
Pilgrim answered with a laugh. *"The women of that household happened to be
some bodhisattvas from somewhere, who had waited for us to teach us a lesson. They
must have left during the night, but unfortunately Zhu Eight Rules has to suffer."* When
Tripitaka heard this, he quickly folded his hands to make a bow. Then they saw a slip of
paper hanging on an old cedar tree, fluttering in the wind. Sha Monk quickly took it
down for his master to read. On it was written the following eight-line poem:
Though the old Dame of Li Shan had no desire,
Guanyin invited her to leave the mount.
Mañjuśri and Viśvabhadra, too, were guests
Who took in the woods the form of maidens fair.
The holy monk's virtuous and truly chaste,
But Eight Rules's profane, loving things mundane.
Henceforth he must repent with quiet heart,
For if he's slothful, the way will be hard.
As the elder, Pilgrim, and Sha Monk recited this poem aloud, they heard a loud
call from deep in the woods:

“Master, the ropes are killing me! Save me, please! I'll never dare do this
again!"*
“Wukong,"* said Tripitaka, *"is it Wuneng who is calling us?"*
*"Yes,"* said Sha Monk. *"Brother,"* said Pilgrim, *"don't bother about him. Let us
leave now."*
“Though Idiot is stupid and mischievous,"* said Tripitaka, *"he is at least fairly
honest, and he has arms strong enough to carry the luggage. Let's have some regard for
the Bodhisattva's earlier intention, let's rescue him so that he may continue to follow us.
I doubt that he'll ever dare do this again."* Sha Monk thereupon rolled up the bedding
and put the luggage in order, after which Great Sage Sun untied the horse to lead the
Tang Monk into the woods to see what had happened. Ah! So it is that
You must take care in the pursuit of truth

To purge desires, and you'll enter the Real. We do not know what sort of good or evil was in store for the Idiot; let's listen to the explanation in the next chapter.
