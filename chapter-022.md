TWENTY-TWO
Eight Rules fights fiercely at the Flowing-Sand River
Mokṣa by order receives Wujing‟s submission
Now we tell you about the Tang Monk and his disciples, the three travelers, who
were delivered from their ordeal. In less than a day they passed the Yellow Wind
Mountain and proceeded toward the West through a vast level plain. Time went by
swiftly, and summer yielded to the arrival of autumn. All they saw were some
Cold cicadas sing on dying willows
As the Great Fire rolls toward the West.
As they proceeded, they came upon a huge and turbulent river, its waves surging
and splashing. “Disciples,” exclaimed Tripitaka, “look at that vast expanse of water in
front of us. Why are there no boats in sight? How can we get across?”
Taking a close look, Eight Rules said, “It‟s very turbulent, too rough for any
boat!” Pilgrim leaped into the air and peered into the distance, shading his eyes with his
hand. Even he became somewhat frightened and said, “Master, it‟s truly hard! Truly
hard! If old Monkey wishes to cross this river, he need only make one twist of his body
and he will reach the other shore. But for you, Master, it‟s a thousand times more
difficult, for you can‟t traverse it even in ten thousand years!”
“I can‟t even see the other shore from here,” said Tripitaka. “Really, how wide is
it?”
“It‟s just about eight hundred miles wide,” said Pilgrim. “Elder Brother,” said
Eight Rules, “how could you determine its width just like that?”
“To tell you the truth, Worthy Brother,” said Pilgrim, “these eyes of mine can
determine good or evil up to a thousand miles away in daylight. Just now when I was up
in the air, I could not tell how long the river was, but I could make out its width to be at
least eight hundred miles.” Sighing anxiously, the elder pulled back his horse and
suddenly discovered on the shore a slab of stone. When the three of them drew closer to
have a look, they saw three words written in seal-script (“Flowing-Sand River”) below
which there were also four lines written in regular style. It read:
These Flowing- Sand metes, eight hundred wide;
These Weak Waters, three thousand deep.
goose feather cannot stay afloat;
A rush petal will sink to the bottom.
As master and disciples were reading the inscription, the waves in the river
suddenly rose like tall mountains, and with a loud splash from the midst of the waters a
monster sprang out. Looking most savage and hideous, he had
A head full of tousled and flame-like hair;
A pair of bright, round eyes which shone like lamps;
An indigo face, neither black nor green;
An old dragon‟s voice like thunderclap or drum.
He wore a cape of light yellow goose down.
Two strands of white reeds tied around his waist.
Beneath his chin nine skulls were strung and hung;
287
287
His hands held an awesome priestly staff.
Like a cyclone, the fiend rushed up to the shore and went straight for the Tang
Monk. Pilgrim was so taken aback that he grabbed his master and dashed for high
ground to make the escape. Putting down the pole, Eight Rules whipped out his rake
and brought it down hard on the monster. The fiend used his staff to parry the blow, and
so the two of them began to unleash their power on the bank of the Flowing-Sand River.
This was some battle!
The nine-pronged rake;
The fiend-routing staff;
These two met in battle on the river shore.
This one was the Marshal of Heavenly Reeds:
That one was the Curtain- Raising Captain by the Throne.
In years past they met in Divine Mists Hall;
Today they fought and waged a test of might.
From this one the rake went out like a dragon stretching its claws;
From that one the staff blocked the way like a sharp-tusked elephant.
They stood with their limbs outstretched;
Each struck at the other‟s rib cage.
This one raked madly, heedless of head or face;
That one struck wildly without pause or rest.
This one was a cannibal spirit, long a lord of Flowing- Sand;
That one was a Way-seeking fighter upholding Law and Faith.
Closing in again and again, the two of them fought for twenty rounds, but
neither emerged the victor.
The Great Sage meanwhile was standing there to protect the Tang Monk. As he
held the horse and guarded the luggage, he became so aroused by the sight of Eight
Rules engaging that fiend that he ground his teeth and rubbed his hands vehemently.
Finally he could not restrain himself—whipping out the rod, he said, “Master, sit here
and don‟t be afraid. Let old Monkey go play with him a little.”
The master begged in vain for him to stay, and with a loud whoop he leaped
forward. The monster, you see, was just having a grand time fighting with Eight Rules,
the two of them so tightly locked in combat that nothing seemed able to part them.
Pilgrim, however, rushed up to the monster and delivered a terrific blow at his head
with his iron rod. The monster was so shaken that he jumped aside: turning around he
dove straight into the Flowing-Sand River and disappeared. Eight Rules was so upset
that he leaped about wildly, crying, “Elder Brother! Who asked you to come? The
monster was gradually weakening and was finding it difficult to parry my rake.
Another four or five rounds and I would have captured him. But when he saw
how fierce you were, he fled in defeat. Now, what shall we do?”
“Brother,” said Pilgrim laughing, “to tell you the truth, since defeating the
Yellow Wind Fiend a month ago, I have not played with my rod all this time after
leaving the mountain.
When I saw how delicious your fight with him was, I couldn‟t stand the itch
beneath my feet! That‟s why I jumped up here to have some fun with him. That monster
doesn‟t know how to play, and I suppose that‟s the reason for his departure.”
288
288
Holding hands and teasing each other, the two of them returned to the Tang
Monk. “Did you catch the monster?” asked the Tang Monk. “He didn‟t last out the
fight,” said Pilgrim, “and he scrambled back to the water in defeat.”
“Disciple,” said Tripitaka, “since this monster has probably lived here a long
time, he ought to know the deep and the shallow parts of the river. After all, such a
boundless body of weak water, and not a boat in sight—we need someone who is
familiar with the region to lead us across.”
“Exactly!” said Pilgrim. “As the proverb says,
He who‟s near cinnabar turns red;
He who‟s near ink becomes black.
The monster living here must have a good knowledge of the water. When we
catch him, we should not slay him, but just make him take Master across the river
before we dispose of him.”
“Elder Brother,” said Eight Rules, “no need for further delay. You go ahead and
catch him, while old Hog guards our master.”
“Worthy Brother,” said Pilgrim with a laugh, “in this case I‟ve really nothing to
brag about, for I‟m just not comfortable doing business in water. If all I do is walk
around down there, I still have to make the magic sign and recite the water-repelling
spell before I can move anywhere. Or else I have to change into a water creature like a
fish, shrimp, crab, or turtle before going in. If it were a matter of matching wits in the
high mountains or up in the clouds, I know enough to deal with the strangest and most
difficult situation. But doing business in water somewhat cramps my style!”
“When I was Marshal of the Heavenly River in former years,” said Eight Rules,
“I commanded a naval force of eighty thousand men, and I acquired some knowledge of
that element. But I fear that that monster may have a few relatives down there in his
den, and I won‟t be able to withstand him if his seventh and eighth cousins all come out.
What will happen to me then if they grab me?”
“If you go into the water to fight him,” said Pilgrim, “don‟t tarry. Make sure, in
fact, that you feign defeat and entice him out here. Then old Monkey will help you.”
“Right you are,” said Eight Rules. “I‟m off!”
He took off his blue silk shirt and his shoes; holding the rake with both hands, he
divided the waters to make a path for himself. Using the ability he had developed in
bygone years, he leaped through billows and waves and headed for the bottom of the
river.
We now tell you about that monster, who went back to his home in defeat. He
had barely caught his breath when he heard someone pushing water, and as he rose to
take a look, he saw Eight Rules pushing his way through with his rake. That monster
lifted his staff and met him face to face, crying, “Monk, watch where you are going or
you‟ll receive a blow from this!” Using the rake to block the blow, Eight Rules said,
“What sort of a monster are you that you dare to bar our way?”
“So you don‟t recognize me,” said the monster.
“I‟m no demon or fiend, nor do I lack a name or surname.”
“If you are no demon or fiend,” said Eight Rules, “why do you stay here and
take human lives? Tell me your name and surname, and I‟ll spare your life.”
289
289
The monster said:
“My spirit was strong since the time of birth.
I once made a tour of the universe,
Where my fame as a hero became well-known—
A gallant type for all to emulate.
Through countless nations I went as I pleased;
Over lakes and seas I did freely roam.
To learn the Way I strayed to Heaven‟s edge;
To find a teacher I stumped this great earth.
For years my clothes and alms bowl went with me:
Not for one day did my spirit turn lax.
For scores of times I cruised cloudlike the earth
And walked to all places a hundred times.
Only then a true immortal I did meet,
Who showed me the Great Path of Golden Light.
I took back Baby Boy and Fair Girl first;
Then released Wood Mother and Squire of Gold.
Bright Hall‟s kidney-brine flooded Floral Pool;
The Tower‟s liver-fire plunged to the heart.
Three thousand merits done, I saw Heaven‟s face
And solemnly worshipped the Point of Light.
Then the Jade Emperor exalted me;
The Curtain- Raising Captain he made me.
An honored one in South Heaven Gate,
I was much esteemed at Divine Mists Hall.
I hung at my waist the Tiger- Headed Shield:
I held in my hands the Fiend- Routing Staff.
Just like the sunlight my gold helmet shone;
My body‟s armor flashed like radiant mists.
I was chief of the guardians of the Throne:
I was first as attendant of the court.
When Queen Mother gave the Festival of Peach—
She served her guests at Jasper Pool a feast—
I dropped and broke a glass-like cup of jade,
And souls from all the hosts of Heaven fled.
Jade Emperor grew mightily enraged;
Hands clasped, he faced his counsel on the left.
Stripped of my hat, my armor, and my rank,
I had my whole body pushed to the block.
Only the Great Immortal, Naked Feet,
Came from the ranks and begged to have me freed.
Pardoned from death and with my sentence stayed,
I was sent to the shores of Flowing- Sand.
Sated, I lie wearily in the stream;
Famished, I churn the waves to find my feed.
The woodsman sees me and his life is gone;
The fishers face me and they soon perish.
From first to last I‟ve eaten many men;
290
290
Over and over I took human lives.
Since you dare to work violence at my door,
My stomach this day has its fondest hopes!
Don‟t say you‟re too coarse to be eaten now.
I‟ll catch you, and look, that‟s my minced meat sauce!”
Infuriated by what he heard, Eight Rules shouted, “You brazen thing! You
haven‟t the slightest perception! Old Hog is tempting enough to make people‟s mouths
water, and you dare say that I‟m coarse, that I‟m to be chopped up for a chopped meat
sauce! Come to think of it, you would like to consider me a piece of tough old bacon!
Watch your manners and swallow this rake of your ancestor!” When the monster saw
the rake coming, he used the style of “the phoenix nodding its head” to dodge the blow.
The two of them thus fought to the surface of the water, each one treading the waters
and waves. This conflict was somewhat different from the one before.
Look at
The Curtain- Raising Captain,
The Marshal of Heavenly Reeds:
Each showing most nicely his magic might.
This one waved above his head the fiend-routing staff:
That one moved the rake as swiftly as his hand.
The vaulting waves rocked hills and streams;
The surging tide the cosmos dimmed.
Savage like Jupiter wielding banners and flags!
Fierce like Hell‟s envoy upsetting sacred tops!
This one guarded the Tang Monk devotedly;
That one, a water fiend, perpetrated his crimes.
The rake‟s one stroke would leave nine red marks:
The staffs one blow would dissolve man‟s soul.
They strove to win the fight;
They struggled to prevail.
All in all for the scripture pilgrim‟s sake,
They vented their fury without restraint.
They brawled till carps and perches lost their newborn scales,
And all turtles damaged their tender shells.
Red shrimps and purple crabs all lost their lives,
And sundry water gods all upward bowed!
You heard only the waves rolled and crashed like thunderclaps.
The world amazed saw sun and moon grow dark!
The two of them fought for two hours, and neither prevailed. It was like
A brass pan meeting an iron broom,
A jade gong facing a golden bell.
We now tell you about the Great Sage, who was standing guard beside the Tang
Monk. With bulging eyes he watched them fighting on the water, but he dared not lift
his hands. Finally, Eight Rules made a half-hearted blow with his rake and, feigning
defeat, turned to flee toward the eastern shore. The monster gave chase and was about to
reach the river bank when our Pilgrim could no longer restrain himself. He abandoned
his master, whipped out the iron rod, leaped to the riverside and struck at the monster‟s
head. Fearing to face him, the monster swiftly dove back into the river. “You Ban-
291
291
Horse-Plague!” shouted Eight Rules. “You impulsive ape! Can‟t you be a bit more
patient? You could have waited until I led him up to high ground and then blocked his
path to the river. We would have caught him then. Now he has gone back in, and when
do you think he‟ll come out again?”
“Idiot,” said Pilgrim laughing, “stop shouting! Let‟s go talk to Master first.”
Eight Rules went with Pilgrim back to high ground to Tripitaka. “Disciple,” said
Tripitaka, bowing, “you must be tired!”
“I won‟t complain about my fatigue,” said Eight Rules. “Let‟s subdue the
monster and take you across the river. Only that plan is perfect!”
Tripitaka said, “How did the battle go with the monster just now?”
“He was just about my equal,” said Eight Rules, “and we fought to a draw. But
then I feigned defeat and he chased me up to the bank. When he saw Elder Brother
lifting his rod, however, he fled.”
“So what are we going to do?” asked Tripitaka. “Master, relax!” said Pilgrim.
“Let‟s not worry now, for it‟s getting late. You sit here on the cliff and let old Monkey
go beg some vegetarian food. Take some rest after you eat, and we‟ll find a solution
tomorrow.”
“You are right,” said Eight Rules. “Go, and come back quickly.” Pilgrim swiftly
mounted the clouds and went north to beg a bowl of vegetarian food from a family to
present to his master. When the master saw him return so soon, he said, “Wukong, let us
go to that household which gave us the food and ask them how we may cross this river.
Isn‟t this better than fighting the monster?” With a laugh, Pilgrim said, “That household
is quite far from here, about six or seven thousand miles, no less! How could the people
there know about the water? What‟s the use of asking them?”
“You are fibbing again, Elder Brother!” said Eight Rules. “Six or seven
thousand miles, how could you cover that distance so quickly?”
“You have no idea,” said Pilgrim, “about the capacity of my cloud somersault,
which with one leap can cover one hundred and eight thousand miles.
For the six or seven thousand here, all I have to do is to nod my head and stretch
my waist, and that‟s a round trip already! What‟s so hard about that?”
“Elder Brother,” said Eight Rules, “if it‟s so easy, all you need to do is to carry
Master on your back: nod your head, stretch your waist, and jump across. Why continue
to fight this monster?”
“Don‟t you know how to ride the clouds?” asked Pilgrim. “Can‟t you carry him
across the river?”
“The mortal nature and worldly bones of Master are as heavy as the Tai
Mountain,”
Eight Rules said. “How could my cloud soaring bear him up? It has to be your
cloud somersault.”
“My cloud somersault is essentially like cloud soaring,” said Pilgrim, “the only
difference being that I can cover greater distances more rapidly. If you can‟t carry him,
what makes you think I can? There‟s an old proverb that says:
Move Mount Tai: it‟s light as mustard seeds.
292
292
Lift a man and you won‟t leave the red dust!
Take this monster here: he can use spells and call upon the wind, pushing and
pulling a little, but he can‟t carry a human into the air.
And if it‟s this kind of magic, old Monkey knows every trick well, including
becoming invisible and making distances shorter. But it is required of Master to go
through all these strange territories before he finds deliverance from the sea of sorrows;
hence even one step turns out to be difficult. You and I are only his protective
companions, guarding his body and life, but we cannot exempt him from these woes,
nor can we obtain the scriptures all by ourselves. Even if we had the ability to go and
see Buddha first, he would not bestow the scriptures on you and me. Remember the
adage:
What‟s easily gotten
Is soon forgotten.”
When Idiot heard these words, he accepted them amiably as instruction. Master
and disciples ate some of the simply prepared vegetarian food before resting on the
eastern shore of the Flowing-Sand River.
The next morning, Tripitaka said, “Wukong, what are we going to do today?”
“Not much,” said Pilgrim, “except that Eight Rules must go into the water
again.”
“Elder Brother,” said Eight Rules, “you only want to stay clean, but you have no
hesitation making me go into the water.”
“Worthy Brother,” said Pilgrim, “this time I‟ll try not to be impulsive. I‟ll let
you trick him into coming up here, and then I‟ll block his retreat along the river bank.
We must capture him.”
Dear Eight Rules! Wiping his face, he pulled himself together.
Holding the rake in both hands, he walked to the edge of the river, opened up a
path in the water, and went to the monster‟s home as before. The monster had just
wakened from his sleep when he heard the sound of water. Turning quickly to look, he
saw Eight Rules approaching with the rake. He leaped out at once and barred the way,
shouting, “Slow down! Watch out for my staff!”
Eight Rules lifted his rake to parry the blow, saying, “What sort of mourning
staff do you have there that you dare ask your ancestor to watch out for it?”
“A fellow like you,” said the monster, “wouldn‟t recognize this!
For years my staff has enjoyed great fame,
At first an evergreen tree in the moon.
Wu Gang cut down from it one huge limb:
Lu Ban then made it, using all his skills.
Within the hub‟s one solid piece of gold:
Outside it‟s wrapped by countless pearly threads.
It‟s called the treasure staff for crushing fiends,
E‟er placed in Divine Mists to quell the ogres.
Since I had made a mighty general‟s rank,
Jade Emperor put it always by my side.
It lengthens or shortens after my desire;
293
293
It grows thick or thin with my command.
It went to guard the Throne at the Peaches Feast:
It served at court in Heaven‟s world above.
On duty it saw the many sages bowed,
And immortals, too, when the screen rolled up.
Of numinous power one arm divine,
It‟s no worldly weapon of humankind.
Since I was banished from the gate of Heav‟n,
It roamed with me at will beyond the seas.
Perhaps it is not right for me to boast,
But swords and spears of man can‟t match this staff.
Look at that old, rusted muckrake of yours:
Fit only for hoeing fields and raking herbs!”
“You unchastened brazen thing!” said Eight Rules, laughing. “Never mind
whether it‟s fit for hoeing fields! One little touch and you won‟t even know how to
begin putting bandages or ointment on nine bleeding holes! Even if you are not killed,
you will grow old with chronic infection!”
The monster raised his hands and again fought with Eight Rules from the bottom
of the river up to the surface of the water. This battle was even more different from the
first one. Look at them
Wielding the treasure staff.
Striking with muckrake;
They would not speak as if they were estranged.
Since Wood Mother constrained the Spatula,
That caused the two to fight most fiercely.
No win or loss;
With no regret.
They churned up waves and billows with no peace.
How could this one control his bitter rage;
That one found unbearable his pain.
Rake and staff went back and forth to show their might;
The water rotted like poison in Flowing- Sand.
They huffed and puffed!
They worked and toiled!
All because Tripitaka would face the West.
The muckrake so ferocious!
The staff so nimbly used!
This one made a grab to pull him up the shore;
That one sought to seize and drown him in the stream.
They roared like thunder, stirring dragon and fish.
Gods and ghosts cowered as the Heavens grew dim.
This time they fought back and forth for thirty rounds, and neither one proved to
be the stronger. Again Eight Rules pretended to be defeated and fled, dragging his rake.
Kicking up the waves, the monster gave chase and they reached the edge of the river.
“Wretch!” cried Eight Rules. “Come up here! We can fight better on solid ground up
here.”
294
294
“You are just trying to trick me into going up there,” scolded the monster, “so
that you can bring out your assistant. You come down here, and we can fight in the
water.”
The monster, you see, had become wise; he refused to go up to the bank and
remained near the edge of the water to argue with Eight Rules.
When Pilgrim saw that the monster refused to leave the water, he became highly
irritated, and all he could think of was to catch him at once. “Master,” he said, “you sit
here. Let me give him a taste of the „ravenous eagle seizing his prey.‟”
He somersaulted into the air and then swooped down onto the monster, who was
still bickering with Eight Rules. When he heard the sound of the wind, he turned
quickly and discovered Pilgrim hurtling down from the clouds. Putting away his staff,
he dove into the water and disappeared. Pilgrim stood on the shore and said to Eight
Rules, “Brother, that monster is catching on! He refuses to come up now. What shall we
do?”
“It‟s hard, terribly hard!” said Eight Rules. “I just can‟t beat him—even when I
summoned up the strength of my milk-drinking days! We are evenly matched!”
“Let‟s go talk to Master,” said Pilgrim.
The two of them went up again to high ground and told the Tang Monk
everything. “If it‟s so difficult,” said the Elder, tears welling up in his eyes, “how can
we ever get across?”
“Master, please don‟t worry,” said Pilgrim. “It is hard for us to cross with this
monster hiding deep in the river. So, don‟t fight with him any more, Eight Rules; just
stay here and protect Master. I‟m going to make a trip up to South Sea.”
“Elder Brother,” said Eight Rules, “what do you want to do at South Sea?”
Pilgrim said, “This business of seeking scriptures originated from the Bodhisattva
Guanyin; the one who delivered us from our ordeals was also the Bodhisattva Guanyin.
Today our path is blocked at this Flowing-Sand River and we can‟t proceed.
Without her, how can we ever solve our problem? Let me go ask her to help us: it‟s
much better than doing battle with this monster.”
“You have a point there, Elder Brother,” said Eight Rules.
“When you get there, please convey my gratitude to her for her kindly
instructions in the past.”
“Wukong,” said Tripitaka, “if you want to go see the Bodhisattva, you needn‟t
delay. Go, and hurry back.” Pilgrim catapulted into the air with his cloud somersault
and headed for the South Sea. Ah! It did not even take him half an hour before he saw
the scenery of the Potalaka Mountain. In a moment, he dropped down from his
somersault and arrived at the edge of the purple bamboo grove, where he was met by
the Spirits of the Twenty-Four Ways. They said to him, “Great Sage, what brings you
here?”
“My master faces an ordeal,” said Pilgrim, “which brings me here specially to
see the Bodhisattva.”
“Please take a seat,” said the spirits, “and allow us to make the announcement.”
One of the spirits who was on duty went to the entrance of the Tidal-Sound Cave,
announcing, “Sun Wukong wishes to have an audience with you.”
295
295
The Bodhisattva was leaning on the rails by the Treasure Lotus Pool, looking at
the flowers with the Pearl-Bearing Dragon Princess. When she heard the announcement,
she went back to the cave, opened the door, and asked that he be shown in. With great
solemnity, the Great Sage prostrated himself before her.
“Why are you not accompanying the Tang Monk?” asked the Bodhisattva. “For
what reason did you want to see me again?”
“Bodhisattva,” said Pilgrim, looking up at her, “my master took another disciple
at the Gao Village, to whom you had given the religious name of Wuneng. After
crossing the Yellow Wind Ridge, we have now arrived at the Flowing-Sand River eight
hundred miles wide, a body of weak water, which is difficult for Master to get across.
There is, moreover, a monster in the river who is quite accomplished in the martial arts.
We are grateful to Wuneng, who fought in the water with him three times but could not
beat him. The monster is, in fact, blocking our path and we cannot get across. That is
why I have come to see you, hoping you will take pity and grant us deliverance.”
“Monkey,” said the Bodhisattva, “are you still acting so smug and self-sufficient
that you refuse to disclose the fact that you are in the service of the Tang Monk?”
“All we had intended to do,” said Pilgrim, “was to catch the monster and make
him take Master across the river. I am not too good at doing business in the water, so
Wuneng went down alone to his lair to look for him, and they had some conversation. I
presume the matter of scripture seeking was not mentioned.”
“That monster in the Flowing-Sand River,” said the Bodhisattva, “happens to be
the incarnate Curtain-Raising Captain, who was also brought into the faith by my
persuasion when I told him to accompany those on their way to acquire scriptures. Had
you been willing to mention that you were a scripture pilgrim from the Land of the East,
he would not have fought you; he would have yielded instead.” Pilgrim said, “That
monster is afraid to fight now; he refuses to come up to the shore and is hiding deep in
the water. How can we bring him to submission? How can my master get across this
body of weak water?”
The Bodhisattva immediately called for Hui‟an. Taking a little red gourd from
her sleeves, she handed it over to him, saying, “Take this gourd and go with Sun
Wukong to the Flowing-Sand River. Call „Wujing,‟ and he‟ll come out at once. You
must first take him to submit to the Tang Monk. Next, string together those nine skulls
of his and arrange them according to the position of the Nine Palaces.
Put this gourd in the center, and you will have a dharma vessel ready to ferry the
Tang Monk across the boundary formed by the Flowing-Sand River.” Obeying the
instructions of his master, Hui‟an left the Tidal-Sound Cave with the Great Sage
carrying the gourd.
As they departed the purple bamboo grove in compliance with the holy
command, we have a testimonial poem:
The Five Phases well matched as Heaven‟s truth,
His former master he can recognize.
Refine the self as base for wondrous use;
Good and bad discerned will reveal the cause.
Metal returns to nature—the same kind are both.
Wood begs for favor: they‟ll all be redeemed.
Two- Earths completes merit to reach the void:
296
296
Water and fire blended, dustless and clean.
In a little while the two of them lowered their clouds and arrived at the FlowingSand River. Recognizing the disciple Mokṣa, Zhu Eight Rules led his master to receive
him. After bowing to Tripitaka, Mokṣa then greeted Eight Rules, who said, “I was
grateful to be instructed by Your Reverence so that I could meet the Bodhisattva. I have
indeed obeyed the Law, and I am happy recently to have entered the gate of Buddhism.
Since we have been constantly on the road, I have yet to thank you. Please forgive me.”
“Let‟s forget about these fancy conversations,” said Pilgrim. “We must go and
call that fellow.”
“Call whom?” asked Tripitaka. Pilgrim replied, “Old Monkey saw the
Bodhisattva and gave her an account of what happened. The Bodhisattva told me that
this monster in the Flowing- Sand River happened to be the incarnation of the CurtainRaising Captain. Because he had sinned in Heaven, he was banished to this river and
became a monster. But he was converted by the Bodhisattva, who had told him to
accompany you to the Western Heaven.
Since we did not mention the matter of seeking scriptures, he fought us bitterly.
Now the Bodhisattva has sent Mokṣa with this gourd, which that fellow will turn into a
dharma vessel to take you across the river.” When Tripitaka heard these words, he
bowed repeatedly to Mokṣa, saying, “I beseech Your Reverence to act quickly.”
Holding the gourd and treading half on cloud and half on fog, Mokṣa moved
directly above the surface of the Flowing-Sand River. He cried with a loud voice,
“Wujing! Wujing! The scripture pilgrim has been here for a long time. Why have you
not submitted?” We now tell you about that monster who, fearful of the Monkey King,
had gone back to the bottom of the river to rest in his den.
When he heard someone call him by his religious name, he knew that it had to
be the Bodhisattva Guanyin. And when he heard, moreover, that the scripture pilgrim
had arrived, he no longer feared the ax or the halberd. Swiftly he leaped out of the
waves and saw that it was the disciple Mokṣa. Look at him! All smiles, he went forward
and bowed, saying, “Your Reverence, forgive me for not coming to meet you. Where is
the Bodhisattva?”
“My teacher did not come,” said Mokṣa, “but she sent me to tell you to become
the disciple of the Tang Monk without delay. You are to take the skulls around your
neck and this gourd, and to fashion with them a dharma vessel according to the position
of the Nine Palaces so that he may be taken across this body of weak water.”
“Where is the scripture pilgrim?” asked Wujing. Pointing with his finger, Mokṣa
said, “Isn‟t he the one sitting on the eastern shore?” Wujing caught sight of Eight Rules
and said, “I don‟t know where that lawless creature came from! He fought with me for
two whole days, never once saying a word about seeking scriptures.” When he saw
Pilgrim, he said again. “That customer is his assistant, and a formidable one, too! I‟m
not going over there!”
“That is Zhu Eight Rules,” said Mokṣa, “and that other one is Pilgrim Sun, both
disciples of the Tang Monk and both converted by the Bodhisattva. Why fear them? I‟ll
escort you to the Tang Monk.” Only then did Wujing put away his precious staff and
straighten his yellow silk shirt.

He jumped ashore and knelt before Tripitaka, saying, “Master, your disciple has
eyes but no pupils, and he failed to recognize your noble features. I have greatly
offended you, and I beg you to pardon me.”
“You bum!” said Eight Rules. “Why did you not submit in the first place? Why
did you only want to fight with me? What do you have to say for yourself?”
“Brother,” said Pilgrim, laughing, “don‟t berate him. It‟s really our fault for not
mentioning that we were seeking scriptures, and we didn‟t tell him our names.”
“Are you truly willing to embrace our faith?” said the elder. “Your disciple was
converted by the Bodhisattva,” said Wujing. “Deriving my surname from the river, she
gave me the religious name Sha Wujing. How could I be unwilling to take you as my
master?”
“In that case,” said Tripitaka, “Wukong may bring over the sacred razor and
shave off his hair.”
The Great Sage indeed took the razor and shaved Wujing‟s head, after which he
came again to pay homage to Tripitaka, Pilgrim, and Eight Rules, thus becoming the
youngest disciple of the Tang Monk. When Tripitaka saw that he comported himself
very much like a monk, he gave him the nickname of Sha Monk. “Since you have
embraced the faith,” said Mokṣa, “there‟s no need for further delay. You must build the
dharma vessel at once.” Not daring to delay, Wujing took off the skulls around his neck
and strung them up with a rope after the design of the Nine Palaces, placing the gourd in
the middle. He then asked his master to leave the shore, and our elder thus embarked on
the dharma vessel. As he sat in the center, he found it to be as sturdy as a little boat. He
was, moreover, supported by Eight Rules on his left and Wujing on his right, while
Pilgrim Sun, leading the dragon-horse, followed in the rear, treading half on cloud and
half on fog. Above their heads Mokṣa also took up his post to give them added
protection. In this way our master of the Law was safely ferried across the boundary of
the Flowing-Sand River: with the wind calm and waves quiet he crossed the weak
water. It was truly as fast as flying or riding an arrow, for in a little while he reached the
other shore, having been delivered from the mighty waves. He did not drag up mud or
water, and happily both his hands and feet remained dry. In sum, he was pure and clean
without engaging in any activity. When master and disciples reached solid ground
again, Mokṣa descended from the auspicious clouds. As he took back his gourd, the
nine skulls changed into nine curls of dark wind and vanished. Tripitaka bowed to thank
Mokṣa and also gave thanks to the Bodhisattva. So it was that Mokṣa went straight back
to the South Sea, while Tripitaka mounted his horse to go to the West. We do not know
how long it took them to achieve the right fruit of scripture acquisition; let‟s listen to the
explanation in the next chapter
