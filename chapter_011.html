            The poem says:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <em>
                A hundred years pass by like flowing streams;<br>
                Like froth and foam a lifetime's work now seems.<br>
                Yesterday faces had a peach's glow;<br>
                Today the temples float up flakes of snow.<br>
                Termites disband—illusion then you'll learn!<br>
                Cuckoos call gravely for your early return.<br>
                Secret good works will always life prolong.<br>
                Virtue's not needy for Heav'n's care is strong.

        <p>
            We now tell you about Taizong, whose soul drifted out of the Tower of Five
            Phoenixes. Everything was blurred and indistinct. It seemed to him that a company of
            imperial guardsmen was inviting him to a hunting party, to which Taizong gladly gave
            his consent and went off with them. They had journeyed for a long time when suddenly
            all the men and horses vanished from sight. He was left alone, walking the deserted
            fields and desolate plains. As he anxiously tried to find his way back, he heard someone
            from beyond calling in a loud voice:
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Great Tang Emperor, come over here! Come over here!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Taizong heard this and looked up. He saw that the man had
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <em>
                A black gauze cap on his head;<br>
                Rhinoceros horns around his waist.<br>
                His head's black gauze hat dangled pliant bands:<br>
                His waist's rhino horns displayed plates of gold.<br>
                He held an ivory plaque sheathed in hallowed mist;<br>
                He wore a silk robe circled by holy light.<br>
                His feet put on a pair of white-soled boots<br>
                For treading cloud and climbing fog;<br>
                He grasped by his heart a book of life and death,<br>
                Which determined one's fate.<br>
                His hair, luxuriant, flew above his ears:<br>
                His beard fluttered and danced around his jaws.<br>
                He was once a prime minister of Tang:<br>
                Now he judged cases to serve Yama King.
            </em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Taizong walked toward him, and the man, kneeling at the side of the road, said
            to him, <em>"Your Majesty, please pardon your subject for neglecting to meet you at a
                greater distance."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Who are you,"</em> asked Taizong, <em>"and for what reason did you come to meet
                me?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The man said, <em>"Half a month ago, your lowly subject met in the Halls of
                Darkness the Dragon Ghost of the Jing River, who was filing suit against Your Majesty
                for having him executed after promising to save him. So the great king Qinguang of the
                first chamber immediately sent demon messengers to arrest you and bring you to trial
                before the Three Tribunes. Your subject learned of this and therefore came here to
                receive you. I did not expect to come late today, and I beg you to forgive me."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"What is your name,"</em> said Taizong, <em>"and what is your rank?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"When your lowly subject was alive,"</em> said that man, <em>"he served on Earth before
                the previous emperor as the district magistrate of Cizhou. Afterwards I was appointed
                vice president of the Board of Rites.<br>
                My surname is Cui and my given name is Jue. In the Region of Darkness I hold
                a judgeship in the Capital of Death."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Taizong was very glad; he went forward and held out his royal hands to raise the
            man up, saying, <em>"I am sorry to have inconvenienced you. Wei Zheng, who serves before
                my throne, has a letter for you. I'm glad that we have a chance to meet here."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The judge expressed his gratitude and asked where the letter was. Taizong took
            it out of his sleeve and handed it over to Cui Jue, who received it, bowing, and then
            opened it and read:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <em>
                Your unworthily beloved brother Wei Zheng sends with bowed head this letter to the Great Judge, my
                sworn brother the Honorable Mr. Cui. I recall our former goodly society, and both your voice and your
                countenance seem to be present with me. Several years have hastened by since I last heard your lofty
                discourse. I could only prepare a few vegetables and fruits to offer to you as sacrifices during the
                festive
                times of the year, though I do not know whether you have enjoyed them or not. I am grateful, however,
                that you have not forgotten me, and that you have revealed to me in my dreams that you, my elder
                brother, have ascended to an even higher office. Unfortunately, the worlds of Light and Darkness are
                separated by a gulf wide as the Heavens, so that we cannot meet face to face. The reason that I am
                writing
                you now is the sudden demise of my emperor, the accomplished Taizong, whose case, I suppose, will be
                reviewed by the Three Tribunes, so that he will certainly be given the opportunity to meet you. I
                earnestly
                beseech you to remember our friendship while you were living and grant me the small favor of allowing
                His Majesty to return to life. This will be a very great favor to me, for which I thank you once more.
            </em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            After reading the letter, the judge said with great delight, <em>"The execution of the
                old dragon the other day by the human judge Wei is already known to your subject, who
                greatly admires him for this deed. I am, moreover, indebted to him for looking after my
                children.
                Since he has written such a letter now, Your Majesty need have no further
                concern. Your lowly subject will make certain that you will be returned to life, to
                ascend once more your throne of jade."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Taizong thanked him.
            As the two of them were speaking, they saw in the distance two young boys in
            blue robes holding banners and flags and calling out, <em>"The King of the Underworld has
                an invitation for you."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Taizong went forward with Judge Cui and the two boys. He suddenly saw a
            huge city, and on a large plaque above the city gate was the inscription in gold letters,
            <em>"The Region of Darkness, The Gate of Spirits."</em> Waving the banners, the blue robes led
            Taizong into the city. As they walked along, they saw at the side of the street the
            emperor's predecessor Li Yuan, his elder brother Jiancheng, and his deceased brother
            Yuanji, who came toward them, shouting, <em>"Here comes Shimin! Here comes Shimin!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The brothers clutched at Taizong and began beating him and threatening
            vengeance. Having no place to dodge, the emperor fell into their clutch; and only when
            Judge Cui called a blue-faced, hook-tusked demon to drive them away could he escape
            and continue his journey.
        </p>
        <p>
            They had traveled no more than a few miles when they arrived at a towering
            edifice with green tiles. This building was truly magnificent. You see
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <em>
                Lightly ten thousand folds of colored mists pile high;<br>
                Dimly a thousand strands of crimson brume appear.<br>
                Heads of wild beasts rear up from the eaves aglow.<br>
                Pairs of lambent roof tiles rise in tiers of five.<br>
                Rows of red-gold nails bore deeply into doors;<br>
                Crosswise, slabs of white jade make up the rails.<br>
                Windows near the lights release morning smoke.<br>
                The screens, the curtains, flash like fiery bolts.<br>
                High-rising towers reach to the azure sky.<br>
                Criss-crossing hallways join the treasure rooms.<br>
                Fragrance from beast-shaped tripods line royal robes;<br>
                Scarlet silk lanterns brighten the portals' leaves.<br>
                On the left, hordes of fierce Bull-heads stand;<br>
                On the right, gruesome Horse-faces line up.<br>
                Gold placards turn to greet the ghosts of the dead;<br>
                White silk descends to lead the deceased souls.<br>
                It bears this name: The Central Gate of Hell,<br>
                The Darkness Hall of the Princes of Hades.
            </em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            As Taizong was looking at the place, there came from within the tinkling of
            girdle jade, the mysterious fragrance of divine incense, and two pairs of torch candles
            followed by the Ten Kings of the Underworld coming down the steps. The Ten Kings
            were:
        </p>
        <p>
            King Qinguang, King of the Beginning River, King of the Song Emperor, King
            of Avenging Ministers, King Yama, King of Equal Ranks, King of the Tai Mountain,
            King of City Markets, King of Complete Change, and King of the Turning Wheel.
            Coming out of the Treasure Hall of Darkness, they bowed to receive Taizong, who,
            feigning modesty, declined to lead the way. The Ten Kings said, <em>"Your Majesty is the
                emperor of men in the World of Light, whereas we are but the kings of spirits in the
                World of Darkness. Such are indeed our appointed stations, so why should you defer to
                us?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"I'm afraid that I have offended all of you,"</em> said Taizong, <em>"so how can I dare to
                speak of observing the etiquette of ghosts and men, of Light and Darkness?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Only after much protestation did Taizong proceed into the Hall of Darkness. After he had greeted
            the Ten Kings properly, they sat down according to the places assigned to hosts and
            guests.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a little while, King Qinguang folded his hands in front of him and came
            forward, saying, <em>"The Dragon Spirit of the Jing River accuses Your Majesty of having
                him slain after promising to save him. Why?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"I did promise him that nothing would happen,"</em> said Taizong, <em>"when the old
                dragon appealed to me in my dream at night. He was guilty, you know, and was
                condemned to be executed by the human judge Wei Zheng. It was to save him that I
                invited Wei Zheng to play chess with me, not anticipating that Wei Zheng could have
                performed the execution in his dream! That was indeed a miraculous stratagem devised
                by the human judge, and, after all, the dragon was also guilty of a mortal offense. I fail
                to see how I am to blame."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            When the Ten Kings heard these words, they replied, bowing, <em>"Even before that dragon was born, it was
                already written on the Book of Death held by the Star of South Pole that he should be slain by a human
                judge. We have known this all along, but the dragon lodged his complaint here and insisted that Your
                Majesty be brought down so that his case might be reviewed by the Three Tribunes. We
                have already sent him on his way to his next incarnation through the Wheel of
                Transmigration. We regret, however, that we have caused Your Majesty the
                inconvenience of this journey, and we beg your pardon for pressing you to come here."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            When they had finished speaking, they ordered the judge in charge of the Books of Life
            and Death to bring out the records quickly so that they could ascertain what the allotted
            time of the emperor was to be. Judge Cui went at once to his chamber and examined,
            one by one, the ages preordained for all the kings in the world that were inscribed in the
            books. Startled when he saw that the Great Tang Emperor Taizong of the South
            Jambūdvīpa Continent was destined to die in the thirteenth year of the period Zhenguan,
            he quickly dipped his big brush in thick ink and added two strokes before presenting the
            book. The Ten Kings took one look and saw that <em>"thirtythree years"</em> was written beneath
            the name Taizong. They asked in alarm, <em>"How long has it been since Your Majesty was
                enthroned?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"It has been thirteen years,"</em> said Taizong. <em>"Your Majesty need have no worry,"</em>
            said King Yama, <em>"for you still have twenty years of life. Now that your case has been
                clearly reviewed, we can send you back to the World of Light."</em> When Taizong heard
            this, he bowed to express his gratitude as the Ten Kings ordered Judge Cui and Grand
            Marshal Chu to accompany him back to life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Taizong walked out of the Hall of Darkness and asked, saluting the Ten Kings
            once again, <em>"What's going to happen to those living in my palace?"</em>
            <em>"Everyone will be safe,"</em> said the Ten Kings, <em>"except your younger sister. It
                appears that she will not live long."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"When I return to the World of Light,"</em> said Taizong, bowing again to thank
            them, <em>"I have very little that I can present you as a token of my gratitude. Perhaps I can
                send you some melons or other kinds of fruit?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Delighted, the Ten Kings said, <em>"We have eastern and western melons here, but we lack southern
                melons."</em> <em>"The moment I
                get back,"</em> said Taizong, <em>"I shall send you some."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            They bowed to each other with hands
            folded, and parted.
            The marshal took the lead, holding a flag for guiding souls, while Judge Cui
            followed behind to protect Taizong. They walked out of the Region of Darkness, and
            Taizong saw that it was not the same road. He asked the judge, <em>"Are we going on the
                wrong way?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"No,"</em> said the judge, <em>"for this is how it is in the Region of Darkness: there is
                away for you to come, but there is no way out. Now we must send Your Majesty off
                from the region of the Wheel of Transmigration, so that you can make a tour of Hell as
                well as be sent on your way to reincarnation."</em>
        </p>
        <p>Taizong had little alternative but to follow their lead.
        </p>
        <p>
            They had gone only a few miles when they came upon a tall mountain. Dark
            clouds touched the ground around it, and black mists shrouded the sky. <em>"Mr. Cui,"</em> said
            Taizong, <em>"what mountain is this?"</em> The judge said, <em>"It's the Mountain of Perpetual
                Shade in the Region of Darkness."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"How can we go there?"</em> asked Taizong fearfully. <em>"Your Majesty need not
                worry,"</em> said the judge, <em>"for your subjects are here to guide you."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Shaking and quaking,
            Taizong followed the two of them and ascended the slope. He raised his head to look
            around and saw that
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <em>
                Its shape was both craggy and curvate,<br>
                And its form was even more tortuous.<br>

                Tall like the Lu summits;<br>
                It was not a famed mountain in the World of Light,<br>
                But a treacherous place in the Region of Darkness.<br>
                Thickets of thorns sheltered monsters;<br>
                Tiers of stone ridges harbored demons.<br>
                No sound of fowl or beast came to one's ears;<br>
                Only ghosts or griffins walked before one's eyes.<br>
                The howling cold wind;<br>
                The endless black mist—<br>
                The howling cold wind was the huffing of infernal hosts;<br>
                The endless black mist was the puffing of demonic troops.<br>
                There was no scenic splendor though one looked high and low;<br>
                All was desolation when one stared left and right.<br>
                At that place there were mountains<br>

                And summits,<br>
                And caves,<br>
                And streams;<br>
                Only no grass grew on the mountains;<br>
                No peaks punctured the sky;<br>
                No travelers scaled the summits;<br>
                No caves ever harbored the clouds;<br>
                No water flowed in the streams.<br>
                They were all specters on the shores,<br>
                And bogies beneath the cliffs.<br>
                The phantoms huddled in the caves,<br>
                And lost souls hid on stream-floors.<br>
                All around the mountain,<br>
                Bull-heads and Horse-faces wildly clamored;<br>
                Half hidden and half in sight,<br>
                Hungry ghosts and needy souls often wept.<br>
                The judge in quest of souls,<br>
                In haste and fury delivered his summons;<br>
                The guard who chased the spirits,<br>
                Snorted and shouted to present his papers.<br>

            Had he not trusted in the judge's protection, Taizong would have never made it
            across this Mountain of Perpetual Shade.

            As they proceeded, they came to a place where there were many halls and
            chambers; everywhere they turned, melancholy cries blasted their ears and grotesque
            sights struck terror in their hearts. <em>"What is this place?"</em> asked Taizong again. <em>"The

            When Taizong heard these words, he was terror-stricken. They went on for a
            little while and came upon a group of demon soldiers, each holding banners and flags
            and kneeling beside the road. <em>"The Guards of the Bridges have come to receive you,"</em>
            they said. The judge ordered them to make way and proceeded to lead Taizong across a
            golden bridge. Looking to one side, Taizong saw another silver bridge, on which there
            were several travelers who seemed to be persons of principle and rectitude, justice and
            honesty. They too were led by banners and flags. On the other side was another bridge,
            with icy wind churning around it and bloody waves seething below. The continuous
            sound of weeping and wailing could be heard. <em>"What is the name of that bridge?"</em> asked
            Taizong. <em>"Your Majesty,"</em> said the judge, <em>"it is the No-Option Bridge. When you reach
                the World of Light, you must have this recorded for posterity.

            While Taizong and his guides were speaking, the several Guardians of the
            Bridge went back to their station. Terrified by his vision, Taizong could only nod his
            head in silent horror. He followed the judge and the grand marshal across the malicious
            water of the No- Option River and the bitter Realm of the Bloody Bowl. Soon they
            arrived at the City of the Dead, where clamoring voices were heard proclaiming
            distinctly, <em>"Li Shimin has come! Li Shimin has come!"</em> When Taizong heard all this
            shouting, his heart shook and his gall quivered. Then he saw a throng of spirits, some
            with backs broken by the rack, some with severed limbs, and some headless, who barred
            his way and shouted together, <em>"Give us back our lives! Give us back our lives!"</em> In terror
            Taizong tried desperately to flee and hide, at the same time crying, <em>"Mr. Cui, save me!
                Mr. Cui, save me!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Your Majesty,"</em> said the judge, <em>"these are the spirits of various princes and their
                underlings, of brigands and robbers from sundry places. Through works of injustice,
                both theirs and others', they perished and are now cut off from salvation because there
                is none to receive them or care for them. Since they have no money or belongings, they
                are ghosts abandoned to hunger and cold. Only if Your Majesty can give them some
                money will I be able to offer you deliverance."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"I came here,"</em> said Taizong, <em>"with empty hands. Where can I get money?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Your Majesty,"</em> said the judge, <em>"there is in the World of the Living a man who
                has deposited great sums of gold and silver in our Region of Darkness. You can use
                your name for a loan, and your lowly judge will serve as your voucher; we shall borrow
                a roomful of money from him and distribute it among the hungry ghosts. You will then
                be able to get past them."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Who is this man?"</em> asked Taizong. <em>"He's a man from the Kaifeng District in
                Henan Province,"</em> said the judge. <em>"His given name is Liang and his surname is Xiang.
                He has thirteen rooms of gold and silver down here. If Your Majesty borrows from him,
                you can repay him when you return to the World of Light."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Highly pleased and more than willing to use his name for the loan, Taizong at
            once signed a note for the judge. He borrowed a roomful of gold and silver, and the
            grand marshal was asked to distribute the money among the ghosts. The judge also
            instructed them, saying, <em>"You may divide up these pieces of silver and gold among
                yourselves and use them accordingly. Let the Great Tang Father pass, for he still has a
                long time to live. By the solemn word of the Ten Kings I am accompanying him to
                return to life. When he reaches the world of the living, he has been instructed to hold a
                Grand Mass of Land and Water for your salvation. So don't start any more trouble."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            When the ghosts heard these words and received the silver and gold, they obeyed and
            turned back. The judge ordered the grand marshal to wave the flag for guiding souls,
            and led Taizong out of the City of the Dead. They set out again on a broad and level
            path, leaving quickly with light, airy steps.
        </p>
        <p>
            They traveled for a long time and arrived at the junction of the Sixfold Path of
            Transmigration. They saw some people who rode the clouds wearing embroidered
            capes, and some with Daoist amulets of gold fish dangling from their waists; there were
            in fact monks, nuns, Daoists, and secular persons, and all varieties of beasts and fowls,
            ghosts and spirits. In an unending stream they all ran beneath the Wheel of
            Transmigration to enter each into a predestined path. <em>"What is the meaning of this?"</em>
            asked the Tang emperor.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Your Majesty,"</em> said the judge, <em>"as your mind is enlightened
                to perceive the pervasive immanence of the Buddha-nature in all things, you must
                remember this and proclaim it in the World of the Living. This is called the Sixfold Path
                of Transmigration. Those who perform good works will ascend to the way of the
                immortals; those who remain patriotic to the end will advance to the way of nobility;
                those who practice filial piety will be born again into the way of blessing; those who are
                just and honest will enter once more into the way of humans; those who cherish virtue
                will proceed to the way of riches; those who are vicious and violent will fall back into
                the way of demons."</em> When the Tang emperor heard this, he nodded his head and sighed,
            saying,
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <em>"Ah, how truly good is goodness!<br>
                To do good will never bring illness!<br>
                In a good heart always abide.<br>
                On a good way your door fling wide.<br>
                Let no evil thoughts arise,<br>
                And all mischief you must despise.<br>
                Don't say there's no retribution,<br>
                For gods have their disposition."</em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The judge accompanied the Tang emperor up to the very entrance to the way of
            nobility before he prostrated himself and called out, <em>"Your Majesty, this is where you
                must proceed, and here your humble judge will take leave of you. I am asking Grand
                Marshal Zhu to accompany you a little further."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Tang emperor thanked him, saying, <em>"I'm sorry, sir, that you have had to
                travel such great distance on my account."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"When Your Majesty returns to the World of Light,"</em> said the judge, <em>"be very
                certain that you celebrate the Grand Mass of Land and Water so that those wretched,
                homeless souls may be delivered. Please do not forget! Only if there is no murmuring
                for vengeance in the Region of Darkness will there be the prosperity of peace in your
                World of Light. If there are any wicked ways in your life, you must change them one by
                one, and you must teach your subjects far and wide to do good. You may be assured
                then that your empire will be firmly established, and that your fame will go down to
                posterity."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Tang emperor promised to grant each one of the judge's requests.
            Having parted from Judge Cui, he followed Grand Marshal Zhu and entered the
            gate. The grand marshal saw inside a black-maned bay horse complete with rein and
            saddle. Lending the emperor assistance from left and right, he quickly helped him
            mount it. The horse shot forward like an arrow, and soon they reached the bank of the
            Wei River, where a pair of golden carps could be seen frolicking on top of the waves.
            Pleased by what he saw, the Tang emperor reined in his horse and stopped to watch.
            <em>"Your Majesty,"</em> said the grand marshal, <em>"let's hurry and get you back into your city
                while there is still time."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            But the emperor persisted in his indulgence and refused to go forward. The
            grand marshal grabbed one of his legs and shouted, <em>"You still won't move? What are
                you waiting for?"</em> With a loud splash, he was pushed off his horse into the Wei River,
            and thus he left the Region of Darkness and returned to the World of Light.
            We shall now tell you about those who served before the Throne in the Tang
            dynasty. Xu Mougong, Qin Shubao, Hu Jingde, Duan Zhixian, Ma Sanbao, Cheng
            Yaojin, Gao Shilian, Li Shiji, Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui, Xiao Yu, Fu Yi, Zhang
            Daoyuan, Zhang Shiheng, and Wang Guei constituted the two groups of civil and
            military officials. They gathered with the crown prince of the Eastern Palace, the queen,
            the ladies of the court, and the chief steward in the Hall of the White Tiger for the
            imperial mourning. At the same time, they discussed issuing the obituary proclamation
            for the whole empire and crowning the prince as emperor. From one side of the hall,
            Wei Zheng stepped forward and said, <em>"All of you, please refrain from doing anything
                hasty. If you alarm the various districts and cities, you may bring about something
                undesirable and unexpected. Let's wait here for another day, for our lord will surely
                come back to life."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"What nonsense you are talking, Prime Minister Wei,"</em> said Xu Jingzong,
            coming from below, <em>"for the ancient proverb says, 'Just as spilled water cannot be
                retrieved, so a dead man can never return!' Why do you mouth such empty words to vex
                our minds? What reason do you have for this?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"To tell you the truth, Mr. Xu,"</em> said Wei Zheng, <em>"I have been instructed since
                my youth in the arts of immortality. My calculations are most accurate, and I promise
                you that His Majesty will not die."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            As they were talking, they suddenly heard a loud voice crying in the coffin,
            <em>"You've drowned me! You've drowned me!"</em> It so startled the civil and military
            officials, and so terrified the queen and the ladies, that every one of them had

            Every person attending the court ran away, and no one dared approach the
            coffin. Only the upright Xu Mougong, the rational Prime Minister Wei, the courageous
            Qin Qiong, and the impulsive Jingde came forward and took hold of the coffin. <em>"Your

            Then, however, Wei Zheng said, <em>"He's not playing ghost. His Majesty is coming
                back to life! Get some tools, quick!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            They opened the top of the coffin and saw indeed that Taizong was sitting up
            inside, still shouting, <em>"You've drowned me! Who bailed me out?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Mougong and the rest
            of them went forward to lift him up, saying, <em>"Don't be afraid, Your Majesty, and wake
                up. Your subjects are here to protect you."</em> Only then did the Tang emperor open his
            eyes and say, <em>"How I suffered just now! I barely escaped attack by spiteful demons
                from the Region of Darkness, only to encounter death by drowning!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Have no fear, Your Majesty,"</em> said the ministers. <em>"What kind of calamity
                occurred in the water?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"I was riding a horse,"</em> the Tang emperor said, <em>"when we came near the Wei
                River where two fishes were playing. That deceitful Grand Marshal Zhu pushed me off
                my horse into the river, and I was almost drowned."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"His Majesty is still not entirely free from the influences of the dead,"</em> said Wei
            Zheng. He quickly ordered from the imperial dispensary medicinal broth designed to
            calm his spirit and fortify his soul. They also prepared some rice gruel, and only after
            taking such nourishments once or twice did he become his old self again, fully regaining
            his living senses. A quick calculation revealed that the Tang emperor had been dead for
            three days and nights and then returned to life to rule again. We have thus a testimonial
            poem:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            From ancient times how oft the world has changed!
            History is full of kingdoms that rise and fall.
            Countless were the wonders of Zhou, Han, and Jin.
            Which could match King Tang's from death to life recall?
        </blockquote>



        By then it was dusk; the various ministers withdrew after they had seen the
        emperor retire. The next day, they took off their mourning garb and changed into their
        court attire: everyone had on his red robe and black cap, his purple sash and gold medal,
        waiting outside the gate to be summoned to court. We now tell you about Taizong, who,
        having received the medicine prescribed for calming his spirit and fortifying his soul,
        and having taken the rice broth several times, was carried into his bedchamber by his
        attendants. He slept soundly that whole night, and when he arose at dawn, his spirit was
        fully revived. Look how he was attired:
        He donned a tall, royal cap;
        He wore a dark ocher robe;
        He put on a belt of green jade from Blue Mountain;
        He trod a pair of empire-building carefree boots.
        His stunning looks
        Surpassed anyone in court:
        With power to spare
        He resumed his reign.
        What a great Tang emperor of justice and truth,
        The Majestic Li who rose again from the dead!
        <p>
            The Tang emperor went up to the Treasure Hall of the Golden Carriage and
            gathered together the two groups of civil and military officials, who, after shouting
            <em>"Long live the emperor"</em> three times, stood in attention according to rank and file. Then
            they heard this loud announcement:
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"If there is any business, come forth and make your memorial; if there is no
                business, you are dismissed from court."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            From the east came the row of civil officials and from the west came the row of
            military officials; they all went forward and prostrated themselves before the steps of
            white jade. <em>"Your Majesty,"</em> they said, <em>"may we inquire how you awoke from your
                slumber, which lasted so long?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"On that day, after we had received the letter from Wei Zheng,"</em> said Taizong,
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"we felt that our soul had departed from these halls, having been invited by the imperial
                guardsmen to join a hunting party. As we were traveling, the men and horses both
                disappeared, whereupon my father, the former emperor, and my deceased brothers came
                to hassle us. We would not have been able to escape them had it not been for the arrival
                of someone in black cap and robe; this man happened to be the judge Cui Jue, who
                managed to send my deceased brothers away. We handed Wei Zheng's letter over to
                him, and as he was reading it, some boys in blue came to lead us with flags and banners
                to the Hall of Darkness, where we were met by the Ten Kings of the Underworld. They
                told us of the Jing River Dragon, who accused us of having him slain after promising to
                save him. We in turn explained to them what happened, and they assured us that our
                case had been jointly reviewed by the Three Tribunes. Then they asked for the
                Chronicles of Life and Death to examine what was to be our allotted age. Judge Cui
                presented his books, and King Yama, after checking them, said that Heaven had
                assigned us a portion of thirty-three years. Since we had ruled for only thirteen years,
                we were entitled to twenty more years of living.
                So Grand Marshal Zhu and Judge Cui were ordered to send us back here. We
                took leave of the Ten Kings and promised to thank them with gifts of melons and other
                fruits. After our departure from the Hall of Darkness, we encountered in the Underworld
                all those who were treasonous to the state and disloyal to their parents, those who
                practiced neither virtue nor righteousness, those who squandered the five grains, those
                who cheated openly or in secret, those who indulged in unjust weights and
                measurements—in sum, the rapists, the thieves, the liars, the hypocrites, the wantons,
                the deviates, the connivers, and the lawbreakers. They were all suffering from various
                tortures by grinding, burning, pounding, sawing, frying, boiling, hanging, and skinning.
                There were tens of thousands of them, and we could not make an end of this ghastly
                sight.
                Thereafter we passed by the City of the Dead, filled with the souls of brigands
                and bandits from all over the Earth, who came to block our path. Fortunately, Judge Cui
                was willing to vouch for us, and we could then borrow a roomful of gold and silver
                from Old Man Xiang of Henan to buy off the spirits before we could proceed once
                more. We finally parted after Judge Cui had repeatedly instructed us that when we
                returned to the World of Light we were to celebrate a Grand Mass of Land and Water
                for the salvation of those orphaned spirits. After leaving the Sixfold Path of
                Transmigration, Grand Marshal Zhu asked us to mount a horse so swift it seemed to be
                flying, and brought me to the bank of the Wei River. As we were enjoying the sight of
                two fishes playing in the water, he grabbed our legs and pushed us into the river. Only
                then did we come back to life."</em>
        </p>
        <p>When the various ministers heard these words, they all
            praised and congratulated the emperor. A notice was also sent out to every town and
            district in the empire, and all the officials presented gratulatory memorials, which we
            shall mention no further.
        </p>
        <p>
            We shall now tell you about Taizong, who proclaimed a general amnesty for the
            prisoners in the empire. Moreover, he asked for an inventory of those convicted of
            capital crimes, and the judge from the Board of Justice submitted some four hundred
            names of those awaiting death by beheading or hanging. Taizong granted them one
            year's leave to return to their families, so that they could settle their affairs and put their
            property in order before going to the marketplace to receive their just deserts. The
            prisoners all thanked him for such grace before departing. After issuing another edict for
            the care and welfare of orphans, Taizong also released some three thousand court
            maidens and concubines from the palace and married them off to worthy military
            officers. From that time on, his reign was truly a virtuous one, to which we have a
            testimonial poem:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <em>
                Great is the virtue of the Great Tang Ruler!<br>
                Surpassing Sage Kings, he makes his people prosper.<br>
                Five hundred convicts may now leave the prison;<br>
                Three thousand maidens find release from the palace.<br>
                The empire's officials all wish him long life.<br>
                The ministers at court all give him high praise.<br>
                Such good heart, once stirred, the Heavens should bless,<br>
                And pass such weal to seventeen generations.<br>
                After releasing the court maidens and convicts, Taizong also issued another<br>
                proclamation to be posted throughout the empire. The proclamation read:<br>
                The cosmos, though vast,<br>
                Is brightly surveyed by the sun and the moon;<br>
                The world, though immense,<br>
                Approves not villains in Heaven or on Earth.<br>
                If your intent is trickery,<br>
                Even this life will bring retribution;<br>
                If your giving exceeds receiving,<br>
                There's blessing not only in the life hereafter.<br>
                A thousand clever designs<br>
                Are not as living according to one's duties;<br>
                Ten thousand men of violence<br>
                Cannot compare with one frugal and content.<br>
                If you're bent on good works and mercy,<br>
                Need you read the sūtras with diligence?<br>
                If you intend to harm others,<br>
                Even the learning of Buddha is vain!
            </em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            From that time on, there was not a single person in the empire who did not
            practice virtue.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, another notice was posted asking for a volunteer to take the melons
            and other fruits to the Region of Darkness. At the same time, a roomful of gold and
            silver from the treasury was sent with the Imperial Duke of Khotan, Hu Jingde, to the
            Kaifeng District of Henan so that the debt to Xiang Liang could be repaid. After the
            notice had been posted for some days, a worthy came forth to volunteer his life for the
            mission. He was originally from Zunzhou; his surname was Liu and his given name
            Quan, and he belonged to a family of great wealth. The reason he came forward was
            that his wife, Li Cuilian, happened to have given a gold hairpin from her head, by way
            of alms, to a monk in front of their house.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Liu Quan chided her for her indiscretion in flaunting herself outside their
            home, Li became so upset that she promptly hanged herself, leaving behind her a pair of
            young children, who wept piteously day and night. Liu Quan was so filled with remorse
            by the sight of them that he was willing to leave life and property to take the melons to
            hell. He therefore took down the royal notice and came to see the Tang emperor. The
            emperor ordered him to go to the Lodge of the Golden Pavilion, where a pair of
            southern melons were put on his head, some money in his sleeve, and some medicine in
            his mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
            So Liu Quan died by taking poison. His soul, still bearing the fruits on his head,
            arrived at the Gate of Spirits. The demon guardian at the door shouted, <em>"Who are you
                that you dare to come here?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"By the imperial command of the Great Tang Emperor Taizong,"</em> said Liu Quan,
            <em>"I came here especially to present melons and other fruits for the enjoyment of the Ten
                Kings of the Underworld."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The demon guardian received him amiably and led him to the Treasure Hall of
            Darkness. When he saw King Yama, he presented the melons, saying, <em>"By order of the
                Tang emperor, I came from afar to present these melons as a token of thanks for the
                gracious hospitality of the Ten Kings."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Highly pleased, King Yama said, <em>"That Emperor Taizong is certainly a man of his word!"</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            He accepted the melons and proceeded to ask the messenger about his name and
            his home. <em>"Your humble servant,"</em> said Liu Quan, <em>"resided originally in Junzhou; my
                surname is Liu and my given name is Quan. Because my wife hanged herself, leaving
                no one to care for our children, I decided to leave home and children and sacrifice my
                life for the country by helping my emperor to take these melons here as a thank
                offering."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            When the Ten Kings heard these words, they asked at once for Li, the wife of
            Liu Quan; she was brought in by the demon guardian, and wife and husband had a
            reunion before the Hall of Darkness. They conversed about what had happened and also
            thanked the Ten Kings for this meeting. King Yama, moreover, examined the Books of
            Life and Death and found that both husband and wife were supposed to live to a ripe old
            age. He quickly ordered the demon guardian to take them back to life, but the guardian
            said, <em>"Since Li Cuilian has been back in the World of Darkness for many days, her body
                no longer exists. To whom should her soul attach herself?"</em>
            <em>"The emperor's sister, Li Yuying,"</em> said King Yama, <em>"is destined to die very
                soon. Borrow her body right away so that this woman can return to life."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The demon guardian obeyed the order and led Liu Quan and his wife out of the
            Region of Darkness to return to life.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not know how the two of them returned to life; let's listen to the
            explanation in the next chapter.
