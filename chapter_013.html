            <em>
                The rich Tang ruler issued a decree,<br>
                Deputing Xuanzang to seek the source of Chan.<br>
                He bent his mind to find the Dragon Den,<br>
                With firm resolve to climb the Vulture Peak.<br>
                Through how many states did he roam beyond his own?<br>
                Through clouds and hills he passed ten thousand times.<br>
                He now leaves the throne to go to the West;<br>
                He'll keep law and faith to reach the Great Void.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            We shall now tell you about Tripitaka, who, on the third day before the fifteenth
            of the ninth month in the thirteenth year of the period Zhenguan, was sent off by the
            Tang emperor and many officials from outside the gate of Chang'an. For a couple of
            days his horse trotted without ceasing, and soon they reached the Temple of the Law
            Gate. The abbot of that temple led some five hundred monks on both sides to receive
            him and took him inside. As they met, tea was served, after which a vegetarian meal
            was presented.
        </p>
        <p>
            Soon after the meal, dusk fell, and thus
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>
                Shadows moved to the Star River's nearing pulse;<br>
                The moon was bright without a speck of dust.<br>
                The wild geese called from the distant sky,<br>
                And washing flails beat from nearby homes.<br>
                As birds returned to perch on withered trees,<br>
                The Chan monks conversed in their Sanskrit tones.<br>
                On rush mats placed upon a single bunk,<br>
                They sat until halfway through the night.<br>
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Beneath the lamps the various monks discussed Buddhist doctrines and the
            purpose of seeking scriptures in the Western Heaven.
            Some pointed out that the waters were wide and the mountains very high; others
            mentioned that the roads were crowded with tigers and leopards; still others maintained
            that the precipitous peaks were difficult to scale; and another group insisted that the
            vicious monsters were hard to subdue. Tripitaka, however, kept his mouth shut tightly,
            but he pointed with his finger to his own heart and nodded his head several times. Not
            perceiving what he meant, the various monks folded their hands and asked, “Why did
            the Master of the Law point to his heart and nod his head?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “When the mind is active,”
        </p>
        <p>
            Tripitaka replied, “all kinds of māra come into existence; when the mind is
            extinguished, all kinds of māra will be extinguished. This disciple has already made an
            important vow before Buddha in the Temple of Transformation, and he has no
            alternative but to fulfill it with his whole heart. If I go, I shall not turn aside until I have
            reached the Western Heaven, seen Buddha, and acquired the scriptures so that the
            Wheel of the Law will be turned to us and the kingdom of our lord will be secured
            forever.” When the various monks heard this statement, everyone congratulated and
            commended him, saying, “A loyal and valiant master!” They praised him unceasingly as
            they escorted him to bed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Soon
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>
                The bamboos struck down the setting moon<br>
                And the cocks crowed to gather the clouds of dawn.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The various monks arose and prepared some tea and the morning meal.
            Xuanzang put on his cassock and went to worship Buddha in the main hall. “Your
            disciple, Chen Xuanzang,” he said, “is on his way to seek scriptures in the Western
            Heaven. But my fleshly eyes are dim and unperceptive and do not recognize the true
            form of the living Buddha. Now I wish to make a vow: that throughout this journey I
            shall burn incense whenever I come upon a temple, I shall worship Buddha whenever I
            meet a Buddha, and I shall sweep a pagoda whenever I reach a pagoda. May our
            Buddha be merciful and soon reveal to me his Diamond Body sixteen feet tall. May he
            grant me the true scriptures so that they may be preserved in the Land of the East.”
        </p>
        <p>
            He finished his prayer and went back to the hall for the vegetarian meal, after
            which his two attendants made ready the saddle and urged him to begin his journey.
            Going out of the temple's gate, Tripitaka took leave of the monks, who grieved to see
            him go. They accompanied him for ten miles before turning back, tears in their eyes, as
            Tripitaka proceeded directly toward the West. It was the time of late autumn. You see
        </p>
        <p>
            Trees growing bare in hamlets as rush petals break;
            From every maple column the red leaves fall.
            Trekkers through paths of mist and rain are few.
            The fair chrysanthemums,
            The sharp mountain rocks,
            Cold streams and cracked lilies all make one sad.
            Snow falls from a frosty sky on rushes and reeds.
            One duck at dusk descends in the distant void.
            Clouds o‟er the wilds move through the gathering gloom.
            The swallows depart;
            The wild geese appear—
            Their cries, though loud, are halting and forlorn.
        </p>
        <p>
            After traveling for several days, master and disciples arrived at the city of
            Gongzhou. They were met at once by the various municipal officials of that city, where
            they spent the night. The next morning they set off again, taking food and drink along
            the way, resting by night and journeying by day. In two or three days, they arrived at the
            District of Hezhou, which formed the border of the Great Tang Empire. When the
            garrison commander of the border as well as the local monks and priests heard that the
            Master of the Law, a bond brother of the emperor, was on his way to the Western
            Heaven to see Buddha by royal commission, they received the travelers with due
            reverence. Some chief priests then invited them to spend the night at Fuyuan Temple,
            where every resident cleric came to pay respect to the pilgrims. Dinner was served, after
            which the two attendants were told to feed the horses well, for the Master wanted to
            leave before dawn. At the first crowing of the cock, he called for his attendants and
            aroused the monks of that temple. They hastened to prepare tea and breakfast, after
            which the pilgrims departed from the border.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because he was somewhat impatient to get going, the Master arose a trifle too
            early. The fact is that this was late autumn, when cocks crow rather early—at about the
            time of the fourth watch. Facing the clear frost and the bright moon, the three of them
            (the horse made up the fourth member of the team) journeyed for some twenty or thirty
            miles, when they came upon a mountain range. It soon became exceedingly difficult for
            them to find their way. As they had to poke around in the grass to look for a path, they
            began to worry that they might be heading in the wrong direction. In that very anxious
            moment, they suddenly tripped; all three of them as well as the horse tumbled into a
            deep pit. Tripitaka was terrified; his companions all shook with fear. They were still
            trembling when they heard voices shouting, “Seize them! Seize them!”
        </p>
        <p>
            A violent wind swept by, and a mob of fifty or sixty ogres appeared, who seized
            Tripitaka with his companions and hauled them out of the pit. Quivering and shivering,
            the Master of the Law stole a glance around and saw a ferocious Monster King seated
            up on high. Truly he had
        </p>
        <p>
            A figure most awesomely bold,
            A face most distinctly fierce.
            Light flashed from his lightninglike eyes;
            All quaked at his thunderous voice.
            His sawlike teeth jutted outward,
            Like fangs they emerged from his jaws.
            Brocade wrapped his body around,
            And coiling stripes covered his spine.
            They saw flesh through sparse, steely whiskers.
            Keen-edged were his claws like sharp swords.
            Even Huang Gong of East Sea would fear
            This white-browed King of Mount South.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tripitaka was so frightened that his spirit left him, while the bones of his
            followers grew weak and their tendons turned numb.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Monster King shouted for them to be bound, and the various ogres tied up
            all three of them with ropes. They were being prepared to be eaten when a clamor was
            heard outside the camp. Someone came in to report:
        </p>
        <p>
            “The Bear Mountain Lord and the Steer Hermit have arrived.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Hearing this, Tripitaka looked up. The first one to come in was a swarthy fellow.
            “How did he look?” you ask.
        </p>
        <p>
            He seemed valiant and courageous,
            With body both tough and brawny.
            His great strength could ford the waters.
            He prowled the woods, flaunting his power.
            Ever a good omen in dreams,
            He showed now his forceful features.
            He could break or climb the green trees,
            And predicted when winter was near.
            Truly he was most clever.
            Hence Mountain Lord was his name.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following behind him was another husky fellow. “How did he look?” you ask.
        </p>
        <p>
            A cap of twin horns rugged,
            And a humpback most majestic.
            His green robe showed his calm nature,
            He walked with a slumberous gait.
            He came from a father named Bull;
            His mother's proper name was Cow.
            A great boon to people who plowed,
            He was thus called the Steer Hermit.
        </p>
        <p>
            The two of them swaggered in, and the Monster King hurried out to receive
            them. The Bear Mountain Lord said, “You are in top form, General Yin.
            Congratulations! Congratulations!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “General Yin looks better than ever,” said the Steer Hermit. “It's marvelous! It's
            marvelous!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “And you two gentlemen, how have you been these days?” asked the Monster
            King. “Just maintaining my idleness,” said the Mountain Lord. “Just keeping up with
            the times,” said the Hermit. After these exchanges, they sat down to chat some more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, one of Tripitaka's attendants was bound so tightly that he began to
            moan pitifully. “How did these three get here?” asked the swarthy fellow. “They
            practically presented themselves at the door!” said the Monster King. “Can they be used
            for the guests‟ dinner?” asked the Hermit, laughing. “By all means!” said the Monster
            King. “Let's not finish them all up,” said the Mountain Lord.
        </p>
        <p>
            “We'll dine on two of them and leave one over.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The Monster King agreed. He called his subordinates at once to have the
            attendants eviscerated and their carcasses carved up; their heads, hearts, and livers were
            to be presented to the guests, the limbs to the host, and the remaining portions of flesh
            and bone to the rest of the ogres. The moment the order was given, the ogres pounced
            on the attendants like tigers preying on sheep: munching and crunching, they devoured
            them in no time at all. The priest nearly died of fear, for this, you see, was his first bitter
            ordeal since his departure from Chang'an.
        </p>
        <p>
            As he was nursing his horror, light began to grow in the east. The two monsters
            did not retire until dawn. Saying, “We‟re beholden to your generous hospitality today.
            Permit us to repay in kind in another time,” they left together. Soon the sun rose high in
            the sky, but Tripitaka was still in a stupor, unable to discern which way was north,
            south, east, or west. In that half-dead condition, he suddenly saw an old man
            approaching, holding a staff in his hands. Walking up to Tripitaka, the man waved his
            hands and all the ropes snapped. He then blew on Tripitaka, and the monk began to
            revive. Falling on the ground, he said, “I thank the aged father for saving the life of this
            poor monk!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Get up,” the old man said, returning his salute, “have you lost anything?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “The followers of your poor monk,” said Tripitaka, “have been eaten by the
            monsters. I have no idea where my horse is or my luggage.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Isn‟t that your horse over there with the two bundles?” asked the old man,
            pointing with his staff. Tripitaka turned around and discovered that his belongings had
            indeed remained untouched. Somewhat relieved, he asked the old man, “Aged father,
            what is this place? How do you happen to be here?”
            “It is called the Double-Fork Ridge, a place infested with tigers and wolves.
            How did you manage to get here?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “At the first crow of the cock,” said Tripitaka, “your poor monk left the District
            of Hezhou. Little did I realize that we had risen too early, and we lost our way tramping
            through fog and dew. We came upon this Monster King so exceedingly ferocious that
            he captured me and my two followers. There was also a swarthy fellow called the Bear
            Mountain Lord and a husky fellow called the Steer Hermit. They arrived and addressed
            the Monster King as General Yin. All three of them devoured my two followers and
            retired only at dawn. I have no idea where I accrued the fortune and merit that caused
            the aged father to rescue me here.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “That Steer Hermit,” said the old man, “is a wild bull spirit; the Mountain Lord,
            a bear spirit; and General Yin, a tiger spirit. The various ogres are all demons of
            mountains and trees, spirits of strange beasts and wolves. Because of the primal purity
            of your nature, they cannot devour you. Follow me now, and I shall lead you on your
            way.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Tripitaka could not be more thankful. Fastening the bundles on the saddle and
            leading his horse, he followed the old man out of the pit and walked toward the main
            road. He tied the horse to the bushes beside the path and turned to thank the aged father.
            At that moment a gentle breeze swept by, and the old man rose into the air and left,
            riding on a white crane with a crimson head. As the wind subsided, a slip of paper
            fluttered down, with four lines of verse written on it:
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>
                I am the Planet Venus from the West,<br>
                Who came to save you by special request,<br>
                Some pupils divine will come to your aid.<br>
                Blame not the scriptures for hardships ahead.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            When Tripitaka read this, he bowed toward the sky saying, “I thank the Gold
            Star for seeing me through this ordeal.”
        </p>
        <p>
            After that, he led his horse off again on his lonely and melancholy journey.
        </p>
        <p>
            On this ridge truly you have
        </p>
        <p>
            Cold and soughing, the wind of the rainforest;
            Purling and gurgling, the water of the brooklets;
            Fragrant and musky, wildflowers in bloom;
            In clutters and clumps, rough rocks piled high;
            Chattering and clattering, the apes and the deer;
            In rank and file, the musk and the fallow deer.
            Chirping and cooing, birds frequently call.
            Silent and still, not one man is in sight.
            That master
            Shivers and quivers to his anxious mind.
            This dear horse,
            Scared and nervous, can barely raise his legs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ready to abandon his body and sacrifice his life, Tripitaka started up that rugged
            mountain. He journeyed for half a day, but not a single human being or dwelling was in
            sight. He was gnawed by hunger and disheartened by the rough road. In that desperate
            moment, he saw two fierce tigers growling in front of him and several huge snakes
            circling behind him; vicious creatures appeared on his left and strange beasts on his
            right. As he was all by himself, Tripitaka had little alternative but to submit himself to
            the will of Heaven. As if to complete his helplessness, his horse's back was sagging and
            its legs were buckling; it went to its knees and soon lay prostrate on the ground. He
            could budge it neither by beating nor by tugging. With hardly an inch of space to stand
            on, our Master of the Law was in the depths of despair, thinking that certain death
            would be his fate. We can tell you, however, that though he was in danger, help was on
            its way. For just as he thought he was about to expire, the vicious creatures began to
            scatter and the monstrous beasts fled; the fierce tigers vanished and the huge snakes
            disappeared. When Tripitaka looked further ahead, he saw a man coming over the
            mountain slope with a steel trident in his hands and bow and arrows at his waist. He was
            indeed a valiant figure! Look at him:
        </p>
        <p>
            He had on his head a cap
            Of leopard skin, spotted and artemisia white;
            He wore on his body a robe
            Of lamb's wool with dark silk brocade.
            Around his waist was tied a lion king belt,
            And on his feet he wore tall boots of suede.
            His eyes would bulge like those of someone hung.
            His beard curled wildly like a fierce god's!
            A bow and poisoned arrows hung on him.
            He held a huge trident of finest steel.
            His voice like thunder appalled mountain cats,
            And wild pheasants quaked at his truculence.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Tripitaka saw him draw near, he knelt at the side of the path and called
            out, his hands clasped in front of him, “Great king, save me! Great king, save me!”
            The fellow came up to Tripitaka and put down his trident. Raising up the monk
            with his hands, he said, “don't be afraid, Elder, for I‟m not a wicked man. I‟m a hunter
            living in this mountain; my surname is Liu and my given name is Boqin. I also go by
            the nickname of Senior Guardian of the Mountain. I came here to find some animals to
            eat, not expecting to run into you. I hope I didn't scare you.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Your poor monk,” said Tripitaka, “is a cleric who has been sent by his Majesty,
            the Tang emperor, to seek scriptures from Buddha in the Western Heaven. When I
            arrived here a few moments ago, I was surrounded by tigers, wolves, and snakes, so that
            I could not proceed. But when the creatures saw you coming they all scattered, and you
            have thus saved my life. Many thanks! Many thanks!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Since I live here and my livelihood depends on killing a few tigers and
            wolves,” said Boqin, “or catching a few snakes and reptiles, I usually frighten the wild
            beasts away. If you have come from the Tang empire, you are actually a native here, for
            this is still Tang territory and I am a Tang subject. You and I both live off the land
            belonging to the emperor so that we are in truth citizens of the same nation. don't be
            afraid. Follow me. You may rest your horse at my place, and I shall see you off in the
            morning.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Tripitaka was filled with delight when he heard these words, and he led his horse
            to follow the hunter.
        </p>
        <p>
            They passed the slope and again heard the howling of the wind. “Sit here,
            Elder,” said Boqin, “and don't move. The sound of that wind tells me that a mountain
            cat is approaching. I'll take him home so that I can make a meal of him for you.” When
            Tripitaka heard this, his heart hammered and his gall quivered and he became rooted to
            the ground. Grasping his trident, that Guardian strode forward and came face to face
            with a great striped tiger. Seeing Boqin, he turned and fled. Like a crack of thunder, the
            Guardian bellowed, “Cursed beast! Where will you flee?” When the tiger saw him
            pressing near, he turned with flailing claws to spring at him, only to be met by the
            Guardian with uplifted trident. Tripitaka was so terrified that he lay paralyzed on the
            grass. Since leaving his mother's belly, when had he ever witnessed such violent and
            dangerous goings-on? The Guardian went after that tiger to the foot of the slope, and it
            was a magnificent battle between man and beast. You see
        </p>
        <p>
            Raging resentment,
            And churning whirlwind.
            In raging resentment
            The potent Guardian's hair pushed up his cap;
            Like churning whirlwind
            The striped prince belched dust, displaying his might.
            This one bared its teeth and wielded its paws;
            That one stepped sideways, yet turning to fight.
            The trident reached skyward, reflecting the sun.
            The striped tail stirred up both fog and cloud.
            This one stabbed madly at the breast of his foe;
            That one, facing him would swallow him whole.
            Stay away and you may live out your years.
            Join the fray and you'll meet Yama, the king!
            You hear the roar of the striped prince
            And the harsh cries of the Guardian.
            The roar of the striped prince
            Shook mountains and streams to frighten birds and beasts;
            The harsh cries of the Guardian
            Unlocked the Heavens to make the stars appear.
            The gold eyeballs of this one protruded,
            And wrath burst from the bold heart of that one.
            Lovable was Liu the Mountain Guardian;
            Praiseworthy was this king of the wild beasts.
            So tiger and man fought, each craving life—
            A little slower, and one forfeits his soul!
        </p>
        <p>
            The two of them fought for about an hour, and as the paws of the tiger began to
            slow and his torso to slacken, he was downed by the Guardian's trident stabbing him
            through the chest. A pitiful sight it was! The points of the trident pierced the heart, and
            at once the ground was covered with blood.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Guardian then dragged the beast by the ear up the road. What a man! He
            hardly panted, nor did his face change color. He said to Tripitaka, “We‟re lucky! We‟re
            lucky! This mountain cat should be sufficient for a day's food for the elder.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Applauding him unceasingly, Tripitaka said, “The Guardian is truly a mountain
            god!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “What ability do I have,” said Boqin, “that I merit such acclaim? This is really
            the good fortune of the father. Let's go. I‟d like to skin him quickly so that I can cook
            some of his meat to entertain you.”
        </p>
        <p>
            He held the trident in one hand and dragged the tiger with the other, leading the
            way while Tripitaka followed him with his horse. They walked together past the slope
            and all at once came upon a mountain village, in front of which were
        </p>
        <p>
            Old trees soaring skyward,
            Roads filled with wild creepers.
            In countless canyons the wind was cool;
            On many ridges came strange sounds and sights.
            One path's wild blooms, their scent clung to one's body;
            A few poles of bamboo, what enduring green!
            The portal of grass,
            The wattle-fenced yard—
            A picture to paint or sketch.
            The stone-slab bridge,
            The white-earth walls—
            How charming indeed, and rare!
            Now in the wistful face of autumn,
            The air was cool and brisk,
            By the wayside yellow leaves fell;
            Over the peaks the white clouds drifted.
            In thinly-grown woods the wild fowls twittered,
            And young dogs yelped outside the village gate.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Boqin reached the door of his house, he threw down the dead tiger and
            called, “Little ones, where are you?” Out came three or four houseboys, all looking
            rather unattractive and mean, who hauled the tiger inside. Boqin told them to skin it
            quickly and prepare it for the guest. He then turned around to welcome Tripitaka into
            his dwelling, and as they greeted each other, Tripitaka thanked him again for the great
            favor of saving his life. “We are fellow countrymen,” said Boqin, “and there's little
            need for you to thank me.”
        </p>
        <p>
            After they had sat down and drunk tea, an old woman with someone who
            appeared to be her daughter-in-law came out to greet Tripitaka.
        </p>
        <p>
            “This is my mother, and this my wife,” said Boqin. “Pray ask your parent to take
            the honored seat,” said Tripitaka, “and let your poor monk pay his respects.”
            “Father is a guest coming from great distance,” said the old woman. “Please
            relax and don't stand on ceremony.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Mother,” said Boqin, “he has been sent by the Tang emperor to seek scriptures
            from Buddha in the Western Heaven. He met your son just now at the ridge. Since we
            are fellow countrymen, I invited him to the house to rest his horse. Tomorrow I shall see
            him on his way.” When she heard these words, the old woman was very pleased.
            “Good! Good! Good!” she said. “The timing couldn‟t be better, even if we had planned
            to invite him. For tomorrow happens to be the anniversary of your late father's death.
            Let us invite the elder to perform some good deeds and recite an appropriate passage of
            scripture. We shall see him off day after tomorrow.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Although he was a tiger slayer, a so-called “Guardian of the Mountain,” our Liu
            Boqin had a good deal of filial feeling for his mother. When he heard what she said, he
            immediately wanted to prepare the incense and the paper money, so that Tripitaka might
            be asked to stay.
        </p>
        <p>
            As they talked, the sky began to darken. The servants brought chairs and a table
            and set out several dishes of well-cooked tiger meat, steaming hot. Boqin invited
            Tripitaka to begin, telling him that rice would follow. “O dear!” said Tripitaka, his
            hands folded. “To tell you the truth, I have been a monk since leaving my mother's
            womb, and I have never eaten any meat.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Hearing this, Boqin reflected awhile. He then said, “Elder, for generations this
            humble family has never kept a vegetarian diet. We could, I suppose, find some bamboo
            shoots and wood ears and prepare some dried vegetables and bean cakes, but they
            would all be cooked with the fat of deer or tigers. Even our pots and pans are greasesoaked! What am I to
            do? I must ask the elder's pardon.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “don't fret,” said Tripitaka. “Enjoy the food yourself. Even if I were not to eat
            for three or four days, I could bear the hunger. But I dare not break the dietary
            commandment.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Suppose you starve to death,” said Boqin, “what then?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I am indebted to the Heavenly kindness of the Guardian,” said Tripitaka, “for
            saving me from the packs of tigers and wolves. Starving to death is better than being
            food for a tiger.” When Boqin's mother heard this, she cried, “Son, stop such idle talk
            with the elder. Let me prepare a vegetarian dish to serve him.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Where would you get such a dish?” said Boqin. “Never mind. I'll fix it,” said
            his mother. She asked her daughter-in-law to take down a small cooking pan and heat it
            until much of the grease had burned off. They washed and scrubbed the pan again and
            again and then put it back on the stove and boiled some water in it. Taking some elm
            leaves from the mountain, they made soup with it, after which they cooked some rice
            with yellow millet mixed with Indian corn. They also prepared two bowls of dried
            vegetables and brought it all out to the table. “Elder,” the aged mother said to Tripitaka,
            “please have some. This is the cleanest and purest food that my daughter-inlaw and I
            have ever prepared.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Tripitaka left his seat to thank her before sitting down again. Boqin removed
            himself to another place; dishes and bowls full of unsauced and unsalted tiger meat,
            musk deer meat, serpent meat, fox flesh, rabbit, and strips of cured venison were set
            before him. To keep Tripitaka company, he sat down and was about to pick up his
            chopsticks when he saw Tripitaka fold his hands and begin to recite something. Startled,
            Boqin dared not touch his chopsticks; he jumped up instead and stood to one side.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having uttered no more than a few phrases, Tripitaka said to him, “Please eat.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “You are a priest who likes to recite short scriptures,” said Boqin. “That was not
            scripture,” said Tripitaka, “only a prayer to be said before meals.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “You people who leave your families,” said Boqin, “are particular about
            everything! Even for a meal you have to mumble something!”
            They ate their dinner and the dishes and bowls were taken away. Evening was
            setting in when Boqin led Tripitaka out of the main hall to go for a walk at the back of
            the dwelling. They passed through a corridor and arrived at a straw shed. Pushing open
            the door, they walked inside, where they found several heavy bows and some quivers of
            arrows hanging on the walls. Two pieces of tiger skin, stinking and bloodstained, were
            draped over the cross beams, and a number of spears, knives, tridents, and rods were
            stuck into the ground at one corner. There were two seats in the middle of the shed, and
            Boqin invited Tripitaka to sit for a moment. Seeing that the place was so gruesome and
            putrid, Tripitaka dared not linger. They soon left the shed and walked further back to a
            huge garden, where there seemed to be no end of thick clumps of chrysanthemum piling
            their gold and stands of maple hoisting their crimson. With a loud rustle, more than a
            dozen fat deer and a large herd of musk deer jumped out. Calm and mild-mannered,
            they were not at all frightened at the sight of human beings. Tripitaka said, “You must
            have tamed these animals.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Like the people in your city of Chang'an,” said Boqin, “where the affluent store
            up wealth and treasures and the landlords gather rice and grain, so we hunters must keep
            some of these wild beasts to prepare against dark days. That's all!”
        </p>
        <p>
            As they walked and conversed, it grew dark, and they returned to the house to
            rest. As soon as the members of the family, young and old, arose next morning, they
            went to prepare vegetarian food to serve to the priest, who was then asked to begin his
            recitations. Having first washed his hands, the priest went to the ancestral hall with the
            Guardian to burn incense. Only after he had bowed to the house shrine did Tripitaka
            beat on his wooden fish and recite first the true sentences for the purification of the
            mouth, and then the divine formula for the purification of mind and body. He went on to
            the Sūtra
        </p>
        <p>
            for the Salvation of the Dead, after which Boqin requested him to compose in
            writing a specific prayer for the deliverance of the deceased. He then took up the
            Diamond Sūtra and the Guanyin Sūtra, each of which was given a loud and clear
            recitation. After lunch, he recited several sections from the Lotus Sūtra and the
            Amitāyus Sūtra, before finishing with the Peacock Sūtra and a brief recounting of the
            story of Buddha healing a bhikṣu.
        </p>
        <p>
            Soon it was evening again. All kinds of incense were burned together with the
            various paper horses, images of the deities, and the prayer for the deliverance of the
            deceased. The Buddhist service was thus completed, and each person retired.
            We shall now tell you about the soul of Boqin's father, verily a ghost redeemed
            from perdition, who came to his own house and appeared to all the members of his
            family in a dream. “It was difficult,” he said, “for me to escape my bitter ordeals in the
            Region of Darkness, and for a long time I could not attain salvation. Fortunately, the
            holy monk's recitations have now expiated my sins. King Yama has ordered someone to
            send me to the rich land of China, where I may assume my next incarnation in a noble
            family. All of you, therefore, must take care to thank the elder, and see that you are not
            negligent in any way. Now I leave you.” So it is that
        </p>
        <p>
            There is, in all things, a solemn purpose:
            To save the dead from perdition and pain.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the whole family awoke from the dream, the sun was already rising in the
            east. The wife of Boqin said, “Guardian, I dreamed last night that father came to the
            house. He said that it was difficult for him to escape his bitter ordeals in the Region of
            Darkness, and that for a long time he could not attain salvation. Fortunately, the holy
            monk's recitations have now expiated his sins, and King Yama has ordered someone to
            send him to the rich land of China where he may assume his next incarnation in a noble
            family. He told us to take care to thank the elder and not be negligent in any way. After
            he had finished speaking, he drifted away, despite my plea for him to stay. I woke up
            and it was all a dream!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I had a dream also,” said Boqin, “one exactly like yours! Let's get up and talk
            to mother about this.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The two of them were about to do so when they heard the old mother calling,
            “Boqin, come here. I want to talk to you.”
        </p>
        <p>
            They went in and found the mother sitting up in bed. “Son,” she said, “I had a
            happy dream last night. I dreamed that your father came to the house saying that, thanks
            to the redemptive work of the elder, his sins had been expiated. He is on his way to the
            rich land of China, where he will assume his next incarnation in a noble family.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Husband and wife laughed uproariously.
        </p>
        <p>
            Boqin said, “Your daughter-in-law and I both had this dream, and we were just
            coming to tell you. Little did we expect that mother's call also had to do with this
            dream.”
        </p>
        <p>
            They therefore called on every member of the family to express their gratitude
            and prepare the monk's horse for travel. They came bowing before the priest and said,
            “We thank the elder for providing life and deliverance for our deceased father, for
            which we can never repay you sufficiently.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “What has this poor monk accomplished,” said Tripitaka, “that merits such
            gratitude?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Boqin gave a thorough account of the dream that the three of them had, and
            Tripitaka was also very pleased. A vegetarian meal was again served, and a tael of silver
            was presented as a token of their gratitude.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tripitaka refused to accept so much as a penny, though the whole family begged
            him earnestly. He only said, “If, in compassion, you can escort me on the first part of
            my way, I shall ever be grateful for such kindness.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Boqin and his mother and wife had little alternative but hastily to prepare some
            biscuits from unrefined flour, which Tripitaka was glad to accept. Boqin was told to
            escort him as far as possible. Obeying his mother's bidding, the Guardian also ordered
            several houseboys to join them, each bringing hunting equipment and weapons. They
            walked to the main road, and there seemed to be no end to the scenic splendor of the
            mountains and peaks.
        </p>
        <p>
            When they had traveled for half a day, they came upon a huge mountain so tall
            and rugged that it truly seemed to touch the blue sky.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a little while the whole company reached the foot of the mountain, and the
            Guardian began to ascend it as if he were walking on level ground. Halfway up, Boqin
            turned around and stood still at the side of the road, saying, “Elder, please go on
            yourself. I must now take leave of you and turn back.” When Tripitaka heard these
            words, he rolled down from his saddle and said, “I beg you to escort me a little further.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “You do not realize, Elder,” said Boqin, “that this mountain is called the
            Mountain of Two Frontiers; the eastern half belongs to our Great Tang domain, but the
            western half is the territory of the Tartars. The tigers and wolves over there are not my
            subjects, nor should I cross the border. You must proceed by yourself.”
        </p>
