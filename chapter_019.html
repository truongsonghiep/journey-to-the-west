        <p>We were telling you about the flaming light of the monster, who was fleeing, while the Great Sage riding the
            rosy clouds followed right behind.As they were thus proceeding, they came upon a tall mountain, where the
            monster gathered together the fiery
            shafts of light and resumed his original form. Racing into a cave, he took out a nine-pronged muckrake to
            fight.</p>
        <p><em>"Lawless monster!"</em> shouted Pilgrim.<em>"What region are you from, fiend, and how do you know old
                Monkey's names? What abilities do you have? Make a full confession quickly and your life may be
                spared!"</em></p>
        <p><em>"So you don't know my powers!"</em> said that monster.<em>"Come up here and brace yourself! I'll tell
                you!</em></p>

        <p>
            <em>
                My mind was dim since the time of youth;<br>
                Always I loved my indolence and sloth.<br>
                Neither nursing nature nor seeking the Real,<br>
                I passed my days deluded and confused.<br>
                I met a true immortal suddenly<br>
                Who sat and spoke to me of cold and heat.<br>
                ' Repent,' he said, 'and cease your worldly way:<br>
                From taking life accrues a boundless curse.<br>
                One day when the Great Limit ends your lot,<br>
                For eight woes and three ways you'll grieve too late!'<br>
                I listened and turned my will to mend my ways:<br>
                I heard, repented, and sought the wondrous rune.<br>
                By fate my teacher he became at once,<br>
                Pointing out passes keyed to Heav'n and Earth.<br>
                Taught to forge the Great Pill Nine Times Reversed,<br>
                I worked without pause through day and night<br>
                To reach Mud- Pill Palace topping my skull<br>
                And Jetting- Spring Points on soles of my feet.<br>
                With kidney brine flooding the Floral Pool,<br>
                My Cinnabar Field was thus warmly nursed.<br>
                Baby and Fair Girl mated as yin and yang;<br>
                Lead and mercury mixed as sun and moon.<br>
                In concord Li-dragon and Kan-tiger used,<br>
                The spirit turtle sucked dry the gold crow's blood.<br>
                ' Three flowers joined on top,' the root reclaimed;<br>
                Five breaths faced their source' and all freely flowed.<br>
                My merit done, I ascended on high,<br>
                Met by pairs of immortals from the sky.<br>
                Radiant pink clouds arose beneath my feet;<br>
                With light, sound frame I faced the Golden Arch.<br>
                The Jade Emperor gave a banquet for gods<br>
                Who sat in rows according to their ranks.<br>
                Made a marshal of the Celestial Stream,<br>
                I took command of both sailors and ships.<br>
                Because Queen Mother gave the Peaches Feast—<br>
                When she met her guests at the Jasper Pool—<br>
                My mind turned hazy for I got dead drunk,<br>
                A shameless rowdy reeling left and right.<br>
                Boldly I barged into Vast Cold Palace<br>
                Where the charming fairy received me in.<br>
                When I saw her face that would snare one's soul,<br>
                My carnal itch of old could not be stopped!<br>
                Without regard for manners or for rank,<br>
                I grabbed Miss Chang'e asking her to bed.<br>
                For three or four times she rejected me:<br>
                Hiding east and west, she was sore annoyed.<br>
                My passion sky-high I roared like thunder,<br>
                Almost toppling the arch of Heaven's gate.<br>
                Inspector General told the Emperor Jade;<br>
                I was destined that day to meet my fate.<br>
                The Vast Cold completely enclosed airtight<br>
                Left me no way to run or to escape.<br>
                Then I was caught by the various gods,<br>
                Undaunted still, for wine was in my heart.<br>
                Bound and taken to see the Emperor Jade,<br>
                By law I should have been condemned to death.<br>
                It was Venus the Gold Star, Mr. Li,<br>
                Who left the ranks and knelt to beg for me.<br>
                My punishment changed to two thousand blows,<br>
                My flesh was torn; my bones did almost crack.<br>
                Alive! I was banished from Heaven's gate<br>
                To make my home beneath the Fuling Mount.<br>
                An errant womb's my sinful destination:<br>
                Stiff- Bristle Hog's my worldly appellation!"
            </em>
        </p>

        <p>When Pilgrim heard this, he said, <em>"So you are actually the Water God of the Heavenly Reeds, who came to
                earth. Small wonder you knew old Monkey's name."</em></p>
        <p><em>"Curses!"</em> cried the monster.<em>"You Heaven-defying Ban-Horse-Plague! When you caused such turmoil
                that year in Heaven, you had no idea how many of us had to suffer because of
                you. And here you are again to make life miserable for others! Don't give me any lip! Have a taste of my
                rake!"</em></p>
        <p>Pilgrim, of course, was unwilling to be tolerant; lifting high his rod, he struck at the monster's head.The
            two of them thus began a battle in the middle of the mountain, in the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>What a fight!</p>
        <p>
            <em>
                Pilgrim's gold pupils blazed like lightning;<br>
                The monster's round eyes flashed like silver blooms.<br>
                This one spat out colored fog:<br>
                That one spouted crimson mist.<br>
                The spouted crimson mist lit up the dark;<br>
                The colored fog spat out made bright the night.<br>
                The golden-hooped rod;<br>
                The nine-pronged muckrake.<br>
                Two true heroes most worthy of acclaim:<br>
                One was the Great Sage descended to earth;<br>
                One was a Marshal who came from Heaven<br>
                That one, for indecorum, became a monster;<br>
                This one, to flee his ordeal, bowed to a monk.<br>
                The rake lunged like a dragon wielding his claws: <br>
                The rod came like a phoenix darting through flowers.<br>
                That one said: "Your breaking up a marriage is like patricide!"<br>
                This one said: "You should be arrested for raping a young girl<br>
                Such idle words!<br>
                Such wild clamor!<br>
                Back and forth the rod blocked the rake.<br>
                They fought till dawn was about to break,<br>
                When the monster‟s two arms felt sore and numb<br>
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>From the time of the second watch, the two of them fought until it was growing light in the east. That
            monster could hold out no longer and fled in defeat. He changed once more into a violent gust of wind and
            went straight back to his cave, shutting the doors
            tightly and refusing to come out.Outside the cave, Pilgrim saw a large stone tablet, which had on it the
            inscription, <em>"Cloudy Paths Cave."</em></p>
        <p>By now, it was completely light. Realizing that the monster was not going to come out, Pilgrim thought to
            himself, <em>"I fear that Master may be anxiously waiting for me. I may as well go back and see him before
                returning here to catch the monster."</em></p>
        <p>Mounting the clouds, he soon arrived at Old Gao village.</p>
        <p>We shall now tell you about Tripitaka, who chatted about past and present with the other elders and did not
            sleep all night. He was just wondering why Pilgrim had not shown up, when suddenly the latter dropped down
            into the courtyard. Straightening out his clothes and putting away his rod, Pilgrim went up to the hall,
            crying, <em>"Master! I've returned!"</em></p>
        <p>The various elders hurriedly bowed low, saying, <em>"Thank you for all the trouble you have been to!"</em>
        </p>
        <p><em>"Wukong, you were gone all night,"</em> said Tripitaka.</p>
        <p><em>"If you captured the monster, where is he now?"</em></p>
        <p><em>"Master,"</em> said Pilgrim, <em>"that monster is no fiend of this world, nor is he a strange beast of
                the mountains. He is actually the incarnation of the Marshal of the Heavenly Reeds. Because he took the
                wrong path of rebirth, his appearance assumed the form of a wild hog: but actually his
                spiritual nature has not been extinguished. He said that he derived his surname from his appearance, and
                he went by the name of Zhu Ganglie. When I attacked him with my rod in the rear building, he tried to
                escape by changing into a violent gust of wind; I then struck at the wind, and he changed into shafts of
                flaming light and retreated to his mountain cave. There he took out a nine-pronged muckrake to do battle
                with old Monkey for a whole night. Just now when it grew light, he could fight no longer and fled into
                the cave, shutting the doors tightly and
                not coming out any more. I wanted to break down the door to finish him off, but I was afraid that you
                might be waiting here anxiously. That's why I came back first to give you some news."</em></p>
        <p>When he had finished speaking, old Mr. Gao came forward and knelt down, saying, <em>"Honored Priest, I have
                no alternative but to say this. Though you have chased him away, he might come back here after you
                leave. What should we do then? I may as well ask you to do us the favor of apprehending him, so that we
                shall not have any further worries. This old man, I assure you, will not be ungrateful or unkind; there
                will be a generous reward for you. I
                shall ask my relatives and friends to witness the drawing up of a document, whereby I shall divide my
                possessions and my property equally with you. All I want is to pluck up the trouble by the root, so that
                the pure virtue of our Gao family will not be tainted."</em></p>
        <p><em>"Aren't you being rather demanding, old man?"</em> said Pilgrim, laughing.<em>That
                monster did tell me that, although he has an enormous appetite and has consumed a
                good deal of food and drink from your family, he has also done a lot of good work for
                you. Much of what you were able to accumulate these last few years you owe to his
                strength, so that he really hasn't taken any free meals from you. Why ever do you want
                to have him driven away? According to him, he is a god who has come down to earth
                and who has helped your family earn a living. Moreover, he has not harmed your
                daughter in any way. Such a son-in-law, I should think, would be a good match for your
                daughter and your family. So, what's all this about ruining your family's reputation and
                damaging your standing in the community? Why not really accept him as he is?"</em></p>
        <p><em>"Honored Priest,"</em> said old Mr. Gao, <em>"though this matter may not offend public
                morals, it does leave us with a bad name. Like it or not, people will say, 'The Gao
                family has taken in a monster as a son-in-law!' How can one stand remarks of that
                kind?"</em></p>
        <p><em>"Wukong,"</em> said Tripitaka, <em>"if you have worked for him all this while, you might
                as well see him through to a satisfactory conclusion."</em></p>
        <p>Pilgrim said, <em>"I was testing him a
                little, just for fun. This time when I go, I'll apprehend the monster for certain and bring
                him back for you all to see. Don't worry, old Gao! Take good care of my master. I'm
                off!"</em></p>
        <p>He said he was off, and the next instant he was completely out of sight. Bounding up that mountain, he
            arrived at the cave's entrance; a few strokes of the iron
            rod reduced the doors to dust.</p>
        <p><em>"You overstuffed coolie!"</em> he shouted, <em>"Come out quickly
                and fight with old Monkey!"</em></p>
        <p>Huffing and puffing, the monster was lying in the cave and trying to catch his
            breath. When he heard his doors being struck down and heard himself called <em>"an overstuffed coolie,"</em>
            he could
            not
            control his wrath.Dragging his rake, he pulled himself together and ran out.</p>
        <p><em>"A Ban-Horse-Plague like you,"</em> he yelled, <em>"is an absolute pest!
                What have I done to you that you have to break my doors to pieces? Go and take a look
                at the law: a man who breaks someone's door and enters without permission may be
                guilty of trespassing, a crime punishable by death!"</em></p>
        <p><em>"Idiot!"</em> said Pilgrim, laughing. <em>"I may have broken down the door, but my case
                is still a defensible one.But you, you took a girl from her family by force—without
            using the proper matchmakers and witnesses, without presenting the proper gifts of
            money and wine. If you ask me, you are the one guilty of a capital crime!"</em></p>
        <p><em>"Enough of this idle talk,"</em> said the monster, <em>"and watch out for old Hog's rake!"</em></p>
        <p>Parrying the rake with his rod, Pilgrim said, <em>"Isn't that rake of yours just something you
                use as a regular farmhand to plow the fields or plant vegetables for the Gao family?</em></p>
        <p>Why on earth should I fear you?"</p>
        <p><em>"You have made a mistake!"</em> said the monster.</p>
        <p><em>"Is this rake a thing of this
                world?</em></p>
        <p>Just listen to my recital:</p>
        <p>This is divine ice steel greatly refined,
            Polished so highly that it glows and shines.
            Laozi wielded the large hammer and tong;
            Mars himself added charcoals piece by piece.
            Five Kings of Five Quarters applied their schemes;
            Twelve Gods of Time expended all their skills.
            They made nine prongs like dangling teeth of jade,
            And brass rings were cast with dropping gold leaves.
            Decked with five stars and six brightnesses,
            Its frame conformed to eight spans and four climes.
            Its whole length set to match the cosmic scheme
            Accorded with yin yang, with the sun and moon:
            Six- Diagram Gods etched as Heaven ruled;
            Eight- Trigram Stars stood in ranks and files.
            They named this the High Treasure Golden Rake,
            A gift for Jade Emperor to guard his court.
            Since I learned to be a great immortal,
            Becoming someone with longevity,
            I was made Marshal of the Heavenly Reeds
            And given this rake, a sign of royal grace.
            When it's held high, there'll be bright flames and light;
            When it's brought low, strong wind blows down white snow.
            The warriors of Heaven all fear it;
            The Ten Kings of Hell all shrink from it.
            Are there such weapons among mankind?
            In this wide world there's no such fine steel.
            It changes its form after my own wish,
            Rising and falling after my command.
            I've kept it with me for several years,
            A daily comrade I never parted from.
            I've stayed with it right through the day's three meals,
            Nor left it when I went to sleep at night.
            I brought it along to the Peaches Feast,
            And with it I attended Heaven's court.
            Since I wrought evil relying on wine,
            Since trusting my strength I displayed my fraud,
            Heaven sent me down to this world of dust,
            Where in my next life I would sin some more.
            With wicked mind I ate men in my cave,
            Pleased to be married at the Gao Village.
            This rake can overturn sea dragons' and turtles' lairs
            And rake up mountain dens of tigers and wolves.
            All other weapons there's no need to name,
            Only my rake is of most fitting fame.
            To win in battle?</p>
        <p>Why, it's no hard thing!
            And making merit?</p>
        <p>It need not be said!
            254
            254
            You may have a bronze head, an iron brain, and a full steel frame.
            I'll rake till your soul melts and your spirit leaks!"</p>
        <p>When Pilgrim heard these words, he put away his iron rod and said, <em>"Don't brag
                too much, Idiot!</em></p>
        <p>Old Monkey will stretch out his head right here, and you can give him
            a blow.</p>
        <p>See if his soul melts and his spirit leaks!"</p>
        <p>The monster did indeed raise his rake high and bring it down with all his might;
            with a loud bang, the rake made sparks as it bounced back up.</p>
        <p>But the blow did not
            make so much as a scratch on Pilgrim's head.</p>
        <p>The monster was so astounded that his
            hands turned numb and his feet grew weak.</p>
        <p>He mumbled, <em>"What a head!</em></p>
        <p>What a head!"</p>
        <p><em>"You didn't know about this, did you?"</em> said Pilgrim.</p>
        <p><em>"When I caused such
                turmoil in Heaven by stealing the magic pills, the immortal peaches, and the imperial
                wine, I was captured by the Little Sage Erlang and taken to the Polestar Palace.</em></p>
        <p>The
            various celestial beings chopped me with an ax, pounded me with a bludgeon, cut me
            with a scimitar, jabbed me with a sword, burned me with fire, and struck me with
            thunder—all this could not hurt me one whit.</p>
        <p>Then I was taken by Laozi and placed in
            his eighttrigram brazier, in which I was refined by divine fire until I had fiery eyes and
            diamond pupils, a bronze head and iron arms.</p>
        <p>If you don't believe me, give me some
            more blows and see whether it hurts me at all."</p>
        <p><em>"Monkey,"</em> said the monster, <em>"I remember that at the time you were causing
                trouble in Heaven, you lived in the Water-Curtain Cave of the Flower-Fruit Mountain,
                in the Aolai Country of the East Pūrvavideha Continent.</em></p>
        <p>Your name hasn't been heard
            of for a long time.</p>
        <p>How is it that you suddenly turn up at this place to oppress me?</p>
        <p>Could my
            father-in-law have gone all that way to ask you to come here?"</p>
        <p><em>"Your father-in-law did not go to fetch me,"</em> said Pilgrim.</p>
        <p><em>"It's old Monkey who
                turned from wrong to right, who left the Daoist to follow the Buddhist.</em></p>
        <p>I am now
            accompanying the royal brother of the Great Tang Emperor in the Land of the East,
            whose name is Tripitaka, Master of the Law.</p>
        <p>He is on his way to the Western Heaven to
            seek scriptures from Buddha.</p>
        <p>We passed through the Gao Village and asked for lodging;
            old man Gao then brought up the subject of his daughter and asked me to rescue her and
            to apprehend you, you overstuffed coolie!"</p>
        <p>Hearing this, the monster threw away his muckrake and said with great
            affability, <em>"Where is the scripture pilgrim?</em></p>
        <p>Please take the trouble of introducing me to
            him."</p>
        <p><em>"Why do you want to see him?"</em> asked Pilgrim.</p>
        <p>The monster said, <em>"I was a
                convert of the Bodhisattva Guanshiyin, who commanded me to keep a vegetarian diet
                here and to wait for the scripture pilgrim.</em></p>
        <p>I was to follow him to the Western Heaven to
            seek scriptures from the Buddha, so that I might atone for my sins with my merit and
            regain the fruits of Truth.</p>
        <p>I have been waiting for a number of years without receiving
            any further news.</p>
        <p>Since you have been made his disciple, why didn't you mention the
            search for scriptures in the first place?</p>
        <p>Why did you have to unleash your violence and
            attack me right at my own door?"</p>
        <p><em>"Don't try to soften me with deception,"</em> said Pilgrim, <em>"thinking that you can
                escape that way. If you are truly sincere about accompanying the Tang Monk, you must
                face Heaven and swear that you are telling the truth. Then I'll take you to see my master."</p>

        At once the monster knelt down and kowtowed as rapidly as if he were pounding
        rice with his head. <em>"Amitāha,"</em> he cried, <em>"Namo Buddha! If I am not speaking the truth
            in all sincerity, let me be punished as one who has offended Heaven—et me be hewn to
            pieces!"</em>
        Hearing him swear such an oath, Pilgrim said, <em>"All right! You light a fire and
            burn up this place of yours; then I'll take you with me."</em>
        The monster accordingly dragged in bunches of rushweed and thorns and lighted
        the fire; the Cloudy Paths Cave soon looked like a derelict potter's kiln. <em>"I have no other
            attachment,"</em> he said to Pilgrim. <em>"You can take me away."</em>
        <em>"Give me your muckrake and let me hold it,"</em> said Pilgrim, and our monster at
        once handed it over. Yanking out a piece of hair, Pilgrim blew onto it and cried,
        <em>"Change!"</em> It changed into a three-ply hemp rope with which he prepared to tie up the
        monster's hands. Putting his arms behind his back, the monster did nothing to stop
        himself from being bound. Then Pilgrim took hold of his ear and dragged him along,
        crying, <em>"Hurry! Hurry!"</em>
        <em>"Gently, please!"</em> pleaded the monster. <em>"You are holding me so roughly, and my
            ear is hurting!"</em>
        <em>"I can't be any gentler,"</em> said Pilgrim, <em>"for I can't worry about you now. As the
            saying goes, 'The nicer the pig, the nastier the grip!' After you have seen my master and
            proved your worth, I'll let you go."</em> Rising up to a distance halfway between cloud and
        fog, they headed straight for the Gao Family Village. We have a poem as a testimony:
        Strong is metal's nature to vanquish wood:
        Mind Monkey has the Wood Dragon subdued.
        With metal and wood both obedient as one,
        All their love and virtue will grow and show.
        One guest and one host there's nothing between;
        Three matings, three unions—there's great mystery!
        Nature and feelings gladly fused as Last and First:
        Both will surely be enlightened in the West.
        In a moment they had arrived at the village. Grasping the rake and pulling at the
        monster's ear, Pilgrim said, <em>"Look at the one sitting in a most dignified manner up there
            in the main hall: that's my master."</em> When old Mr. Gao and his relatives suddenly saw
        Pilgrim dragging by the ear a monster who had his hands bound behind his back, they
        all gladly left their seats to meet them in the courtyard.
        The old man cried, <em>"Honored Priest! There's that son-in-law of mine."</em> Our
        monster went forward and fell on his knees, kowtowing to Tripitaka and saying,
        <em>"Master, your disciple apologizes for not coming to meet you. If I had known earlier
            that my master was staying in my father-in-law's house, I would have come at once to
            pay my respects, and none of these troubles would have befallen me."</em>
        <em>"Wukong,"</em> said Tripitaka, <em>"how did you manage to get him here to see me?"</em>
        Only then did Pilgrim release his hold. Using the handle of the rake to give the monster
        a whack, he shouted, <em>"Idiot! Say something!"</em>
        The monster gave a full account of how the Bodhisattva had converted him.
        Greatly pleased, Tripitaka said at once, <em>"Mr. Gao, may I borrow your incense
            table?"</em> Old Mr. Gao took it out immediately, and Tripitaka lighted the incense after
        256
        256
        purifying his hands. He bowed toward the south, saying, <em>"I thank the Bodhisattva for
            her holy grace!"</em>
        The other elders all joined in the worship by adding incense, after which
        Tripitaka resumed his seat in the main hall and asked Wukong to untie the monster.
        Pilgrim shook his body to retrieve his hair, and the rope fell off by itself. Once more the
        monster bowed to Tripitaka, declaring his intention to follow him to the West, and then
        bowed also to Pilgrim, addressing him as <em>"elder brother"</em> because he was the senior
        disciple.
        <em>"Since you have entered my fold and have decided to become my disciple,"</em> said
        Tripitaka, <em>"let me give you a religious name so that I may address you properly."</em>
        <em>"Master,"</em> said the monster, <em>"the Bodhisattva already laid hands on my head and
            gave me the commandments and a religious name, which is Zhu Wuneng (Awake to
            Power)."</em>
        <em>"Good! Good!"</em> said Tripitaka, laughing. <em>"Your elder brother is named Wukong
            and you are called Wuneng; your names are well in accord with the emphasis of our
            denomination."</em>
        <em>"Master,"</em> said Wuneng, <em>"since I received the commandments from the
            Bodhisattva, I was completely cut off from the five forbidden viands and the three
            undesirable foods. I maintained a strict vegetarian diet in my father-in-law's house,
            never touching any forbidden food. Now that I have met my master today, let me be
            released from my vegetarian vow."</em>
        <em>"No, no!"</em> said Tripitaka. <em>"Since you have not eaten the five forbidden viands
            and the three undesirable foods, let me give you another name. Let me call you Eight
            Rules."</em>
        Delighted, Idiot said, <em>"I shall obey my master."</em>
        For this reason, he was also called Zhu Eight Rules.
        When old Mr. Gao saw the happy ending of this whole affair, he was more
        delighted than ever. He ordered his houseboys immediately to prepare a feast to thank
        the Tang Monk. Eight Rules went forward and tugged at him, saying, <em>"Papa, please ask
            my humble wife to come out and greet the granddads and uncles. How about it?"</em>
        <em>"Worthy brother!"</em> said Pilgrim, laughing. <em>"Since you have embraced Buddhism
            and become a monk, please don't ever mention 'your humble wife' again. There may be
            a married Daoist in this world, but there's no such monk, is there? Let's sit down,
            rather, and have a nice vegetarian meal. We'll have to start off soon for the West."</em> Old
        Mr. Gao set the tables in order and invited Tripitaka to take the honored seat in the
        middle:
        Pilgrim and Eight Rules sat on both sides while the relatives took the remaining
        seats below. Mr. Gao opened a bottle of dietary wine and filled a glass: he sprinkled a
        little of the wine on the ground to thank Heaven and Earth before presenting the glass to
        Tripitaka. <em>"To tell you the truth, aged sir,"</em> said Tripitaka, <em>"this poor monk has been a
            vegetarian from birth. I have not touched any kind of forbidden food since childhood."</em>
        <em>"I know the reverend teacher is chaste and pure,"</em> said old Mr. Gao, <em>"and I did
            not dare bring forth any forbidden foodstuff. This wine is made for those who maintain
            a vegetarian diet: there's no harm in your taking a glass."</em>
        257
        257
        <em>"I just don't dare use wine,"</em> said Tripitaka. <em>"for the prohibition of strong drink is
            a monk's first commandment."</em>
        Alarmed, Wuneng said, <em>"Master, though I kept a vegetarian diet, I didn't cut out
            wine."</em>
        <em>"Though my capacity is not great,"</em> said Wukong, <em>"and I'm not able to handle
            more than a crock or so, I haven't discontinued the use of wine either."</em>
        <em>"In that case,"</em> said Tripitaka, <em>"you two brothers may take some of this pure
            wine. But you are not permitted to get drunk and cause trouble."</em> So the two of them
        took the first round before taking their seats again to enjoy the feast. We cannot tell you
        in full what a richly laden table that was, and what varieties of delicacies were
        presented.
        After master and disciples had been feted, old Mr. Gao took out a red lacquered
        tray bearing some two hundred taels of gold and silver in small pieces, which were to be
        presented to the three priests for travel expenses. There were, moreover, three outer
        garments made of fine silk. Tripitaka said, <em>"We are mendicants who beg for food and
            drink from village to village. How could we accept gold, silver, and precious clothing?"</em>
        Coming forward and stretching out his hand, Pilgrim took a handful of the
        money, saying, <em>"Gao Cai, yesterday you took the trouble to bring my master here, with
            the result that we made a disciple today. We have nothing to thank you with. Take this
            as remuneration for being a guide; perhaps you can use it to buy a few pairs of straw
            sandals. If there are any more monsters, turn them over to me and I'll truly be grateful
            to you."</em>
        Gao Cai took the money and kowtowed to thank Pilgrim for his reward. Old Mr.
        Gao then said, <em>"If the masters do not want the silver and gold, please accept at least
            these three simple garments, which are but small tokens of our goodwill."</em>
        <em>"If those of us who have left the family,"</em> said Tripitaka again, <em>"accept the bribe
            of a single strand of silk, we may fall into ten thousand kalpas from which we may
            never recover. It is quite sufficient that we take along the leftovers from the table as
            provisions on our way."</em>
        Eight Rules spoke up from the side:
        <em>"Master, Elder Brother, you may not want these things. But I was a sonin- law in
            this household for several years, and the payment for my services should be worth more
            than three stones of rice! Father, my shirt was torn by Elder Brother last night; please
            give me a cassock of blue silk. My shoes are worn also, so please give me a good pair of
            new shoes."</em> When old Mr. Gao heard that, he dared not refuse; a new pair of shoes and
        a cassock were purchased at once so that Eight Rules could dispose of the old attire.
        Swaggering around, our Eight Rules spoke amiably to old Mr. Gao, saying,
        <em>"Please convey my humble sentiments to my mother-inlaw, my great-aunt, my second
            aunt, and my uncle-in-law, and all my other relatives. Today I am going away as a
            monk, and please do not blame me if I cannot take leave of them in person. Father, do
            take care of my better half. If we fail in our quest for scriptures, I'll return to secular life
            and live with you again as your son-in-law."</em>
        <em>"Coolie!"</em> shouted Pilgrim. <em>"Stop babbling nonsense!"</em>
        258
        258
        <p><em>"It's not nonsense,"</em> said Eight Rules.</p>
        <p><em>"Sometimes I fear that things may go
                wrong, and then I could end up unable either to be a monk or to take a wife, losing out
                on both counts."</em></p>
        <p><em>"Less of this idle conversation!"</em> said Tripitaka.</p>
        <p><em>"We must hurry up and leave."</em></p>
        <p>They packed their luggage, and Eight Rules was told to carry the load with a
            pole.</p>
        <p>Tripitaka rode on the white horse, while Pilgrim led the way with the iron rod
            across his shoulders.</p>
        <p>The three of them took leave of old Mr. Gao and his relatives and
            headed toward the West.</p>
        <p>We have a poem as testimony:</p>
        <p>The earth's mist-shrouded, the trees appear tall.</p>
        <p>The Buddha-son of Tang court ever toils.</p>
        <p>He eats in need rice begged from many homes;</p>
        <p>He wears when cold a robe patched a thousandfold.</p>
        <p>Holdfast at the breast the Horse of the Will!</p>
        <p>The Mind- Monkey is sly—let him not wail!</p>
        <p>Nature one with feelings, causes all joined —</p>
        <p>The moon's full of gold light when hair is shorn.</p>
        <p>The three of them proceeded toward the West, and for about a month it was an
            uneventful journey.</p>
        <p>When they crossed the boundary of Qoco, they looked up and saw a
            tall mountain.</p>
        <p>Tripitaka reined in his horse and said, <em>"Wukong, Wuneng, there's a tall
                mountain ahead.
                We must approach it with care."</em></p>
        <p><em>"It's nothing!"</em> said Eight Rules.</p>
        <p><em>"This mountain is called the Pagoda Mountain
                and a Crow's Nest Chan Master lives there, practicing austerities.</em></p>
        <p>Old Hog has met him
            before."</p>
        <p><em>"What's his business?"</em> said Tripitaka.</p>
        <p><em>"He's fairly accomplished in the Way,"</em>
            said Eight Rules, <em>"and he once asked me to practice austerities with him.</em></p>
        <p>But I didn't
            go, and that was the end of the matter."</p>
        <p>As master and disciple conversed, they soon arrived at the mountain.</p>
        <p>What a
            splendid mountain!</p>
        <p>You see
            South of it, blue pines, jade-green junipers;</p>
        <p>North of it, green willows, red peach trees.</p>
        <p>A clamorous din:
            The mountain fowls are conversing.</p>
        <p>A fluttering dance:
            Immortal cranes unite in flying.</p>
        <p>A dense fragrance:
            The flowers in a thousand colors.</p>
        <p>A manifold green:
            Diverse plants in forms exotic.</p>
        <p>In the stream green water flows bubbling;
            Before the cliff float petals of hallowed cloud.</p>
        <p>Truly a place of rare beauty, a well-secluded spot;
            Silence is all, not a man to be seen.</p>
        <p>As the master sat on his horse, peering into the distance, he saw on top of the
            fragrant juniper tree a nest made of dried wood and grass.</p>
        <p>To the left, musk deer carried
            259
            259
            flowers in their mouths; to the right, mountain monkeys were presenting fruits.</p>
        <p>At the
            top of the tree, blue and pink phoenixes sang together, soon to be joined by a
            congregation of black cranes and brightly colored pheasants.</p>
        <p><em>"Isn't that the Crow's Nest
                Chan Master?"</em> asked Eight Rules, pointing.</p>
        <p>Tripitaka urged on his horse and rode up to
            the tree.</p>
        <p>We now tell you about that Chan Master, who, seeing the three of them
            approach, left his nest and jumped down from the tree.</p>
        <p>Tripitaka dismounted and prostrated himself.</p>
        <p>Raising him up with his hand, the
            Chan Master said, <em>"Holy Monk, please arise! Pardon me for not coming to meet you."</em></p>
        <p><em>"Old Chan Master,"</em> said Eight Rules, <em>"please receive my bow!"</em></p>
        <p><em>"Aren't you the Zhu Ganglie of the Fuling Mountain?"</em> asked the Chan Master,
            startled.</p>
        <p><em>"How did you have the good fortune to journey with the holy monk?"</em></p>
        <p><em>"A few years back,"</em> said Eight Rules, <em>"I was beholden to the Bodhisattva
                Guanyin for persuading me to follow him as a disciple."</em></p>
        <p><em>"Good! Good! Good!"</em> said the Chan Master, greatly pleased.</p>
        <p>Then he pointed to
            Pilgrim and asked, <em>"Who is this person?"</em></p>
        <p><em>"How is it that the old Chan recognizes him,"</em> said Pilgrim, laughing, <em>"and not
                me?"</em></p>
        <p><em>"Because I haven't had the pleasure of meeting you,"</em> said the Chan Master.</p>
        <p>Tripitaka said, <em>"He is my eldest disciple, Sun Wukong."</em></p>
        <p>Smiling amiably, the Chan
            Master said, <em>"How impolite of me!"</em></p>
        <p>Tripitaka bowed again and asked about the distance to the Great Thunderclap
            Temple of the Western Heaven.</p>
        <p><em>"It's very far away! Very far away!"</em> said the Chan
            Master.</p>
        <p><em>"What's more, the road is a difficult one, filled with tigers and leopards."</em></p>
        <p>With
            great earnestness, Tripitaka asked again, <em>"Just how far is it?"</em></p>
        <p><em>"Though it may be very far,"</em> answered the Chan Master, <em>"you will arrive there
                one day.</em></p>
        <p>But all those māra hindrances along the way are hard to dispel.</p>
        <p>I have a Heart
            Sūtra here in this scroll; it has fifty-four sentences containing two hundred and seventy
            characters.</p>
        <p>When you meet these māra hindrances, recite the sūtra and you will not
            suffer any injury or harm."</p>
        <p>Tripitaka prostrated himself on the ground and begged to receive it, whereupon
            the Chan Master imparted the sūtra by reciting it orally.</p>
        <p>The sūtra said:</p>
        <p>HEART SŪTRA OF THE GREAT PERFECTION OF WISDOM When the Bodhisattva Guanzizai was
            moving in the deep course of the Perfection of Wisdom, she saw that the five heaps were but emptiness,
            and she transcended all sufferings.</p>
        <p>Śārīputra, form is no different from emptiness, emptiness no different
            from form; form is emptiness, and emptiness is form.</p>
        <p>Of sensations, perceptions, volition, and
            consciousness, the same is also true.</p>
        <p>Śārīputra, it is thus that all dharmas are but empty appearances,
            neither produced nor destroyed, neither defiled nor pure, neither increasing nor decreasing.</p>
        <p>This is why in
            emptiness there are no forms and no sensations, perceptions, volition, or consciousness; no eye, ear, nose,
            tongue, body, or mind; no form, sound, smell, taste, touch, or object of mind.</p>
        <p>There is no realm of sight;
            [and so forth], until we reach the realm of no mind-consciousness; there is no ignorance, nor is there
            extinction of ignorance; [and so forth], until we reach the stage where there is no old age and death, nor
            is
            there the extinction of old age and death; there is no suffering, annihilation, or way; there is no
            cognition
            or attainment.</p>
        <p>Because there is nothing to be attained, the mind of the Bodhisattva, by virtue of reliance
            upon the Perfection of Wisdom, has no hindrances: no hindrances, and therefore, no terror or fear; he is
            far removed from error and delusion, and finally reaches Nirvāṇa.</p>
        <p>All the Buddhas of the three worlds
            rely on the Perfection of Wisdom, and that is why they attain the ultimate and complete enlightenment.</p>
        <p>Know, therefore, that the Perfection of Wisdom is a great divine spell, a spell of great illumination, a
            spell
            260
            260
            without superior, and a spell without equal.</p>
        <p>It can do away with all sufferings—such is the unvarnished
            truth.</p>
        <p>Therefore, when the Spell of the Perfection of Wisdom is to be spoken, say this spell: <em>"Gate! Gate!
                Pāragate! Pārasaṃgate! Bodhisvāhā!"</em></p>
        <p>Now because that master of the law from the Tang court was spiritually
            prepared, he could remember the Heart Sūtra after hearing it only once.</p>
        <p>Through him, it
            has come down to us this day.</p>
        <p>It is the comprehensive classic for the cultivation of
            Perfection, the very gateway to becoming a Buddha.</p>
        <p>After the transmission of the sūtra, the Chan Master trod on the cloudy
            luminosity and was about to return to his crow's nest.</p>
        <p>Tripitaka, however, held him back and earnestly questioned him again about the
            condition of the road to the West.</p>
        <p>The Chan Master laughed and said:</p>
        <p><em>"The way is not too hard to walk;
                Try listening to what I say.

                When you reach those sky-touching cliffs,
                Fear not and put your mind at rest.
                Crossing the Rub Ear Precipice,
                You must walk with steps placed sideways.

                Graying wolves act as registrars.
                Lions, elephants—all called kings!
                Leopards, tigers are coachmen all!

                <p><em>"It's not nonsense,"</em> said Eight Rules.</p>
                <p><em>"Sometimes I fear that things may go
                        wrong, and then I could end up unable either to be a monk or to take a wife, losing out
                        on both counts."</em></p>
                <p><em>"Less of this idle conversation!"</em> said Tripitaka.</p>
                <p><em>"We must hurry up and leave."</em></p>
                <p>They packed their luggage, and Eight Rules was told to carry the load with a
                    pole.</p>
                <p>Tripitaka rode on the white horse, while Pilgrim led the way with the iron rod
                    across his shoulders.</p>
                <p>The three of them took leave of old Mr. Gao and his relatives and
                    headed toward the West.</p>
                <p>We have a poem as testimony:</p>
                <p>The earth's mist-shrouded, the trees appear tall.</p>

                <p>The moon's full of gold light when hair is shorn.</p>
                <p>The three of them proceeded toward the West, and for about a month it was an
                    uneventful journey.</p>
                <p>When they crossed the boundary of Qoco, they looked up and saw a
                    tall mountain.</p>
                <p>Tripitaka reined in his horse and said, <em>"Wukong, Wuneng, there's a tall
                        mountain ahead.
                        We must approach it with care."</em></p>
                <p><em>"It's nothing!"</em> said Eight Rules.</p>
                <p><em>"This mountain is called the Pagoda Mountain
                        and a Crow's Nest Chan Master lives there, practicing austerities. Old Hog has met him
                        before."</em></p>
                <p><em>"What's his business?"</em> said Tripitaka.</p>
                <p><em>"He's fairly accomplished in the Way,"</em>
                    said Eight Rules, <em>"and he once asked me to practice austerities with him. But I didn't
                        go, and that was the end of the matter."</em></p>
                <p>As master and disciple conversed, they soon arrived at the mountain.</p>
                <p>What a
                    splendid mountain!</p>
                <p>You see
                    South of it, blue pines, jade-green junipers;</p>
                <p>North of it, green willows, red peach trees.</p>
                <p>A clamorous din:
                    The mountain fowls are conversing.</p>
                <p>A fluttering dance:
                    Immortal cranes unite in flying.</p>
                <p>A dense fragrance:
                    The flowers in a thousand colors.</p>
                <p>A manifold green:
                    Diverse plants in forms exotic.</p>
                <p>In the stream green water flows bubbling;
                    Before the cliff float petals of hallowed cloud.</p>
                <p>Truly a place of rare beauty, a well-secluded spot;
                    Silence is all, not a man to be seen.</p>
                <p>As the master sat on his horse, peering into the distance, he saw on top of the
                    fragrant juniper tree a nest made of dried wood and grass.</p>
                <p>To the left, musk deer carried
                    flowers in their mouths; to the right, mountain monkeys were presenting fruits.</p>
                <p>At the
                    top of the tree, blue and pink phoenixes sang together, soon to be joined by a
                    congregation of black cranes and brightly colored pheasants.</p>
                <p><em>"Isn't that the Crow's Nest
                        Chan Master?"</em> asked Eight Rules, pointing.</p>
                <p>Tripitaka urged on his horse and rode up to
                    the tree.</p>
                <p>We now tell you about that Chan Master, who, seeing the three of them
                    approach, left his nest and jumped down from the tree.</p>
                <p>Tripitaka dismounted and prostrated himself.</p>
                <p>Raising him up with his hand, the
                    Chan Master said, <em>"Holy Monk, please arise! Pardon me for not coming to meet you."</em></p>
                <p><em>"Old Chan Master,"</em> said Eight Rules, <em>"please receive my bow!"</em></p>
                <p><em>"Aren't you the Zhu Ganglie of the Fuling Mountain?"</em> asked the Chan Master,
                    startled.</p>
                <p><em>"How did you have the good fortune to journey with the holy monk?"</em></p>
                <p><em>"A few years back,"</em> said Eight Rules, <em>"I was beholden to the Bodhisattva
                        Guanyin for persuading me to follow him as a disciple."</em></p>
                <p><em>"Good! Good! Good!"</em> said the Chan Master, greatly pleased.</p>
                <p>Then he pointed to
                    Pilgrim and asked, <em>"Who is this person?"</em></p>
                <p><em>"How is it that the old Chan recognizes him,"</em> said Pilgrim, laughing, <em>"and not
                        me?"</em></p>
                <p><em>"Because I haven't had the pleasure of meeting you,"</em> said the Chan Master.</p>
                <p>Tripitaka said, <em>"He is my eldest disciple, Sun Wukong."</em></p>
                <p>Smiling amiably, the Chan
                    Master said, <em>"How impolite of me!"</em></p>
                <p>Tripitaka bowed again and asked about the distance to the Great Thunderclap
                    Temple of the Western Heaven.</p>
                <p><em>"It's very far away! Very far away!"</em> said the Chan
                    Master.</p>
                <p><em>"What's more, the road is a difficult one, filled with tigers and leopards."</em></p>
                <p>With
                    great earnestness, Tripitaka asked again, <em>"Just how far is it?"</em></p>
                <p><em>"Though it may be very far,"</em> answered the Chan Master, <em>"you will arrive there
                        one day. But all those māra hindrances along the way are hard to dispel. I have a Heart
                        Sūtra here in this scroll; it has fifty-four sentences containing two hundred and seventy
                        characters. When you meet these māra hindrances, recite the sūtra and you will not
                        suffer any injury or harm."</em></p>
                <p>Tripitaka prostrated himself on the ground and begged to receive it, whereupon
                    the Chan Master imparted the sūtra by reciting it orally.</p>
                <p>The sūtra said:</p>
                <p>HEART SŪTRA OF THE GREAT PERFECTION OF WISDOM When the Bodhisattva Guanzizai was
                    moving in the deep course of the Perfection of Wisdom, she saw that the five heaps were but
                    emptiness,
                    and she transcended all sufferings.</p>
                <p>Śārīputra, form is no different from emptiness, emptiness no different
                    from form; form is emptiness, and emptiness is form.</p>
                <p>Of sensations, perceptions, volition, and
                    consciousness, the same is also true.</p>
                <p>Śārīputra, it is thus that all dharmas are but empty appearances,
                    neither produced nor destroyed, neither defiled nor pure, neither increasing nor decreasing.</p>
                <p>This is why in
                    emptiness there are no forms and no sensations, perceptions, volition, or consciousness; no eye,
                    ear, nose,
                    tongue, body, or mind; no form, sound, smell, taste, touch, or object of mind.</p>
                <p>There is no realm of sight;
                    [and so forth], until we reach the realm of no mind-consciousness; there is no ignorance, nor is
                    there
                    extinction of ignorance; [and so forth], until we reach the stage where there is no old age and
                    death, nor is
                    there the extinction of old age and death; there is no suffering, annihilation, or way; there is no
                    cognition
                    or attainment.</p>
                <p>Because there is nothing to be attained, the mind of the Bodhisattva, by virtue of reliance
                    upon the Perfection of Wisdom, has no hindrances: no hindrances, and therefore, no terror or fear;
                    he is
                    far removed from error and delusion, and finally reaches Nirvāṇa.</p>
                <p>All the Buddhas of the three worlds
                    rely on the Perfection of Wisdom, and that is why they attain the ultimate and complete
                    enlightenment.</p>
                <p>Know, therefore, that the Perfection of Wisdom is a great divine spell, a spell of great
                    illumination, a spell
                    without superior, and a spell without equal.</p>
                <p>It can do away with all sufferings—such is the unvarnished
                    truth.</p>
                <p>Therefore, when the Spell of the Perfection of Wisdom is to be spoken, say this spell: <em>"Gate!
                        Gate!
                        Pāragate! Pārasaṃgate! Bodhisvāhā!"</em></p>
                <p>Now because that master of the law from the Tang court was spiritually
                    prepared, he could remember the Heart Sūtra after hearing it only once.</p>
                <p>Through him, it
                    has come down to us this day.</p>
                <p>It is the comprehensive classic for the cultivation of
                    Perfection, the very gateway to becoming a Buddha.</p>
                <p>After the transmission of the sūtra, the Chan Master trod on the cloudy
                    luminosity and was about to return to his crow's nest.</p>
                <p>Tripitaka, however, held him back and earnestly questioned him again about the
                    condition of the road to the West.</p>
                <p>The Chan Master laughed and said:</p>
                <p><em>"The way is not too hard to walk;
                        Try listening to what I say.
                        thousand hills and waters deep;
                        Places full of goblins and snags;
                        When you reach those sky-touching cliffs,
                        Fear not and put your mind at rest.
                        Crossing the Rub Ear Precipice,
                        You must walk with steps placed sideways.
                        Take care in the Black Pine Forest;
                        Fox-spirits will likely bar your way.
                        Griffins will fill the capitals;
                        Monsters all mountains populate;
                        Old tigers sit as magistrates;
                        Graying wolves act as registrars.
                        Lions, elephants—all called kings!
                        Leopards, tigers are coachmen all!
                        A wild pig totes a hauling pole;
                        You'll meet ahead a water sprite.
                        An old stone ape of many years
                        Now nurses over there his spite!
                        Just ask that acquaintance of yours:
                        Well he knows the way to the West."</em></p>
                <p>Hearing this, Pilgrim laughed with scorn and said, <em>"Let's go. Don't ask him, ask
                        me! That's enough!"</em></p>
                <p>Tripitaka did not perceive what he meant. The Chan Master, changing into a
                    beam of golden light, went straight up to his crow's nest, while the priest bowed toward
                    him to express his gratitude. Pilgrim lifted his iron rod and thrust it upward
                    violently, but garlands of blooming lotus flowers were seen together with a thousandlayered shield
                    of auspicious
                    clouds. Though Pilgrim might have the strength to overturn
                    rivers and seas, he could not catch hold of even one strand of the crow's nest.When
                    Tripitaka saw this, he pulled Pilgrim back, saying, <em>"Wukong, why are you jabbing at the
                        nest of a bodhisattva like him?"</em></p>
                <p><em>"For leaving like that after abusing both my brother and me,"</em> said Pilgrim.</p>
                <p><em>"He
                        was speaking of the way to the Western Heaven,"</em> said Tripitaka.</p>
                <p><em>"Since when did he abuse you?"</em></p>
                <p><em>"Didn't you get it?"</em> asked Pilgrim.</p>
                <p><em>"He said, 'A wild pig totes a hauling pole,'
                        and insulted Eight Rules.</em></p>
                <p>'An old stone ape of many years' ridiculed old Monkey.</p>
                <p>How
                    else would you explain that?"
            </em></p>
        <p><em>"Elder Brother,"</em> said Eight Rules, <em>"don't be angry.
                This Chan Master does know
                the events of past and future.
                Let's see if his statement, 'You'll meet ahead a water
                sprite,' will be fulfilled or not.
                Let's spare him and leave."</em>
            Pilgrim saw the lotus flowers
            and auspicious fog near the nest, and he had little alternative than to ask his master to
            mount so that they could descend from the mountain and proceed toward the West. Lo, their journey</p>
        <p>
            <em>
                Thus shows that in man's world pure leisure is rare,<br>
                But evils and ogres are rife in the hills!

        </p>

        <p>We really do not know what took place in the journey ahead; let's listen to the
            explanation in the next chapter.</p>
