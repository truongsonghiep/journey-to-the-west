NINETY-FIVE
Falsely assuming true form, the jade hare's caught
True Yin returns to the right to join Numinous Source
We tell you now about that Tang Monk, who dolefully followed the king into
the inner palace, where he heard the loud noise of music and drums and encountered
strong whiffs of rare perfume. Lowering his head, he dared not look up at all. Pilgrim,
however, was secretly delighted. Perched on his master's Vairocana hat, he exercised
his magic perception and stared everywhere with his fiery eyes and diamond pupils.
Two rows of palace maidens, colorfully dressed, stood in waiting, so enhancing the
place that it seemed like a flower palace or divine residence and more attractive than the
silken drapes in the breeze of spring. Truly
They are both graceful and lissome,
With substance like jade and flesh like ice.
Pairs and pairs, more charming than Chu maidens;
Two by two they rival Xi Shi in beauty.
Phoenixes rear up from coiffures piled high;
Like distant hills are moth brows faintly drawn.
That graceful playing of reeds,
That frequent blowing of flutes—
The tones—gong, shang, jue, zhi, and yu—
High and low make their lyric flow.
Wondrous songs and dances e'er lovable;
Silk and floral clusters all agreeable.
When Pilgrim saw that his master was completely unmoved, he said to himself
in silent praise, “Marvelous monk! Marvelous monk!
Living midst silk and satin he's not enticed;
Walking through opulence he's not beguiled.”
In a little while, the princess, with the queen and the concubines thronging
around her, walked out of the Magpie Palace to receive the king, all crying, “Long live
Your Majesty! Long live Your Majesty!”
The elder became so flustered that he shook all over, not knowing what to do at
all. Pilgrim, on the other hand, at once perceived that there was a slight manifestation of
monstrous aura on top of the princess's head, although it did not seem too virulent. He
quickly crawled near his master's ear to whisper:
“Master, that princess is a false one.”
“If she is not a true princess,” said the elder, “how can we make her reveal her
true form?”
“By showing my dharma body,” replied Pilgrim, “I'll capture her immediately.”
“No! No!” said the elder. “You might frighten the throne. Let the monarch and
the queen retire first. Then you may exercise your magic power.”
That Pilgrim, however, had been impetuous all his life. How could he permit
this? With a roar he revealed his original form and dashed forward. Grabbing the
1246
1246
princess, he cried, “You cursed beast! You make the false become real here! Isn't it
enough for you to enjoy yourself at this place? Why must you be so greedy as to want to
deceive my master and ruin his true yang to satisfy your lust?”
These words rendered the king dumb and stupid with fear, and sent the queen
and concubines tumbling all over. Every one of those gaily attired girls and palace
maidens darted east and west, fleeing for her life. This was what their condition was
like:
A spring wind breezy—
Autumn air blustery—
The breezy spring wind passes garden and wood
And a thousand blossoms quiver;
The blustery autumn air comes to the courts
And myriad leaves flutter.
The blasted peony falls beneath the fence,
And blown-up peony lies beside the rails.
The shore's hibiscus trembles;
The steps' crysanthemum heaps up.
The pyrus turns feeble and sinks to the dust;
The rose, still fragrant, lies in the wilds.
The spring wind severs the lotus stalks;
The winter snow crushes the plum's young buds.
Pomegranate petals
Scatter east and west in the inner palace;
Willow twigs by the shore
Dangle north and south of the royal mansion.
In one night a wild storm of wind and rain
Does with dying redness the landscape stain.
More flustered than ever and shaking all over, Tripitaka embraced the king and
said only, “Your Majesty, please don't be afraid.
Please don't be afraid! This is how my mischievous disciple must work his
magic power to distinguish truth and falsehood.” We tell you now about that monsterspirit, who saw that things were going badly. She struggled free, ripped off her clothes,
and flung away her earrings, bracelets, and jewels. Dashing into the shrine of the local
spirit at the imperial garden, she took out a short, pestlelike club, turned and struck
madly at Pilgrim. Pilgrim caught up with her and faced her with the iron rod. The two of
them, screaming and shouting, started a battle in the garden, which continued in midair
when both of them displayed their magic powers and mounted cloud and fog. In this
very conflict,
The golden-hooped rod has both name and fame,
But a club like a pestle no one knows.
One seeking true scriptures has reached this place;
One for love of strange blossoms has come to stay.
The fiend, long knowing of the Tang sage monk,
Desires to unite with his primal sperm.
Abducting the true princess the year before,
She took human form as the king's belov'd.
The Great Sage now perceives her monstrous air;
1247
1247
He would save life by making known the truth.
The short club works violence, bashing the head;
The iron rod with power hits the face.
Loud and boisterous the two of them fight
As mist and cloud remove the sun from sight.
As the two of them waged a fierce battle in midair, they filled the populace of
the whole city with horror and terrified the officials of the entire court.
Supporting the king with his hands, the elder could only say, “Please don't be
afraid! Please tell our lady, the queen, and the rest not to fear. Your princess is actually
someone specious who has taken on the true princess' form. When my disciple captures
her, you will know the difference.” Several of the more courageous palace ladies took
the clothing and jewels to show to the queen, saying, “These were worn by the princess.
Now she has abandoned everything. Stark naked, she is fighting that monk in the sky.
She must be a monstrous deviate.”
By then the king, the queen, and the royal concubines had grown calmer and
began to stare at the sky. We shall leave them for the moment.
We tell you now about that monster-spirit, who battled the Great Sage for half a
day, and they fought to a draw. Tossing the rod up into the air, Pilgrim cried, “Change!”
The single rod changed into ten rods; the ten became a hundred, and the hundred
turned into thousands. Like slithering snakes and gliding dragons in midair, these rods
madly attacked the monstrous deviate. Completely flustered, the monstrous deviate
transformed herself into a clear breeze and fled toward the region above the blue sky.
Pilgrim recited a spell, which reduced the iron rods to a single piece, before mounting
the auspicious luminosity to give chase. When they approached the West Heaven Gate,
they could see gleaming banners fluttering.
“Those guarding the Heaven Gate,” shouted Pilgrim, “block the monster-spirit!
Don't let her escape!”
The Devarāja Dh0tarāṣṭra indeed led the Four Grand Marshals Pang, Liu, Gou,
and Bi to bar the way, each wielding his weapon. Unable to proceed, the monstrous
deviate spun around and began to battle with Pilgrim once more, brandishing her short
club.
As he wielded his iron rod to meet her, the Great Sage stared at the club and saw
that it was thick on one end and thin on the other. It resembled, in fact, a pestle used for
hulling grain. “Cursed beast!” he cried. “What sort of weapon is that you have there that
you dare oppose old Monkey? Submit at once, lest one blow of my rod smash your
skull!”
Clenching her teeth, the monstrous deviate said, “So, you don't know about this
weapon of mine! Listen to my recital!
This divine root's a piece of mutt on jade,
Its form cut and polished for countless years.
I owned it already when Chaos parted;
Twas my possession when the world began.
No mortal thing could with its source compare,
For its nature came from Heaven above.
Its golden-light frame with Four Signs accords,
With Three Primes fused with Five Phases' breaths.
1248
1248
In Toad Palace it has long stayed with me,
A frequent companion by Cassia Hall.
For love of flowers I came down to Earth
And went to India, posing as a girl.
I shared the king's joys with no other wish
Than wedding the Tang Monk to seal my fate.
How wicked you are that you wreck our match!
So savage that you hunt me down to fight!
This weapon of mine has tremendous fame,
Surpassing greatly your golden-hooped rod.
A pestle for herbs in Vast- Cold Palace,
Its one blow will send one to Yellow Spring.”
On hearing this, Pilgrim laughed scornfully and said, “Dear cursed beast! If you
had lived in the Toad Palace, you couldn't be ignorant of old Monkey's abilities, could
you? And you still dare take a stand here? Reveal your form and surrender at once, and
I'll spare your life!”
“I recognize that you are the Ban-Horse-Plague,” said the fiend, “who greatly
disturbed the Celestial Palace five hundred years ago. I should defer to you, I suppose.
But ruining one's marriage is an act of bitter enmity like murdering one's parents.
Neither reason nor sentiment would allow me to give in, and that's why I'm going to
fight you Heaven-defying Ban-HorsePlague!” Now, those three words, Ban-HorsePlague, were most irksome to the Great Sage. When he heard them, he became enraged
and immediately raised his iron rod to strike at her face. The monstrous deviate wielded
her club to meet him, and right before the West Heaven Gate they locked in savage
combat once more. In this battle,
The golden-hooped rod,
The pestle for herbs,
Two weapons divine formed a worthy match
That one for marriage descended to Earth;
This one protecting the Tang Monk arrived here.
The king, actually, was not quite upright—
His love of flowers won a fiend's delight
And brought on this moment a bitter fight,
Both parties stirred to stubbornness and hate.
They charged and sallied to see who would win;
With taunts and slurs they waged a war of words.
The mighty pestle was rare in the world;
The rod's divine strength had e'en more appeal.
Golden beams flashing lit up Heaven's gate;
Cold mists lambent spread throughout the Earth.
They fought back and forth for over ten rounds.
The monster, growing weak, now lost her ground.
That monster-spirit fought more than ten rounds with Pilgrim. When she saw
how taut and fast was the style of the rod, she realized that it would be difficult for her
to prevail. After one feeble blow with her club, she shook her body and changed into
myriad shafts of golden light to flee toward the south. The Great Sage gave chase, and
they suddenly reached a huge mountain. The monster's golden light lowered and
1249
1249
entered a mountain cave, completely disappearing from sight. Fearing that she might
sneak back to the kingdom to harm the Tang Monk, Pilgrim took careful note of the
shape of that mountain before reversing the direction of his cloud to return to the
kingdom himself.
This was about the hour of the Monkey. The king, tugging at Tripitaka, was still
shaking all over. “Sage monk, please save me!” was all he could say. Those concubines
and the queen, too, were quite apprehensive when they saw the Great Sage dropping
down from the edge of the clouds.
“Master,” he cried, “I'm back!”
“Stand still, Wukong,” said Tripitaka, “and don't alarm His Majesty. Let me ask
you what, in fact, has become of the princess?” Standing outside the gate to the Magpie
Palace, with hands folded across his chest, Pilgrim said, “The false princess is a
monstrous deviate. At first I fought with her for half a day. When she found that she
could not prevail, she changed into a clear breeze and fled toward the gate of Heaven. I
shouted for the celestial deities to bar her way. She changed back to her form and again
fought over ten rounds with me. Once more she changed into shafts of golden light to
flee to a mountain due south of here. I chased her there but couldn't find her. Fearing
that she may come back here to harm you, I came back to look after you.” When the
king heard this, he tugged at the Tang Monk to ask, “If the false princess is a monstrous
deviate, where is our real princess?”
“Let me catch the false princess first,” Pilgrim responded at once, “and your real
princess will naturally return to you.” When the queen and palace ladies heard this
declaration, their fears were lifted. Each one of them went forward, bowed low, and
said, “I beg the sage monk to rescue our real princess and bring her back. When this
whole affair has been cleared up, you will be amply rewarded.”
“This is no place for us to talk,” said Pilgrim. “Let His Majesty go to the main
hall with my master. And let the queen and her companions return to their palaces. Have
my brothers Eight Rules and Sha Monk summoned to the palace so that they may give
my master protection. I can then leave to subdue the monster. In that way, proper
etiquette for what is public and private will be observed, and I shall be spared from
worry. Please take note of what I have said, for it betokens a great deal of energy
expended.”
The king was most grateful to follow his suggestion. Hand in hand, he walked
with the Tang Monk to the main hall, while the queen and the ladies returned to their
own palaces. The king then asked for the preparation of a vegetarian meal and sent for
Eight Rules and Sha Monk. In a little while the two of them arrived, and Pilgrim gave
them a thorough account of what had taken place and enjoined them to protect their
master with all diligence. Mounting the cloud somersault, our Great Sage hurtled
through the air and left. All those officials before the main hall bowed low to the sky,
and we shall leave them there for the moment.
The Great Sage Sun headed straight for the mountain to the south of the
kingdom to begin his search. The monstrous deviate, you see, had fled there in defeat;
on reaching the mountain, she crawled inside her lair and used pieces of rock to stop up
its entrance.
Terribly dismayed, she hid herself and kept totally out of sight. Pilgrim searched
for a while, but he could detect no movement whatever. Growing anxious, he made the
magic sign with his fingers and recited a spell to summon into his presence the local
1250
1250
spirit and the mountain deity for interrogation. The two gods arrived and immediately
kowtowed, both crying, “We didn't know! We didn't know! If we had known, we
would have gone far to receive you. We beg you to pardon us.”
“I'll not hit you just yet,” said Pilgrim. “Let me question you instead. What's the
name of this mountain? How many monster-spirits are to be found here? Tell me the
truth and I'll pardon you.”
“Great Sage,” those two deities said, “this mountain is named Mount Hairbrush.
It has three rabbit lairs in it.
From antiquity till now there has never been any monster-spirit, for it is a
blessed land of complete circularity. If the Great Sage wishes to find monsterspirits,
he'd better stick to the road to the Western Heaven.” Pilgrim said, “When old Monkey
arrived at the Kingdom of India in the Western Heaven, he discovered that the princess,
the daughter of the king, had been abducted by a monster-spirit and left in the wilds.
The monster-spirit assumed the form of the princess to deceive the king into erecting a
festooned tower, from which she would toss an embroidered ball to select her husband.
When I escorted my master beneath the tower, she purposely threw the ball on the Tang
Monk, for she wanted to become his mate so that she could steal his primal yang
through temptation. I saw through all that and revealed myself in the palace to capture
her. Stripping off her human clothes and jewelry, she fought with me for half a day,
wielding a short club called a pestle for herbs. Then she changed into a clear breeze to
flee, but old Monkey caught up with her before the West Heavenly Gate, and we fought
for another ten rounds or more.
Realizing that she could not prevail, she changed into beams of golden light and
fled here. Why is it that she can't be seen now?” When the two deities heard this, they
led Pilgrim at once to search the three rabbit lairs. They began with the one at the foot
of the mountain; looking there, they could see only a few wild rabbits, which were
frightened away. When they searched their way up to the hole on the peak, however,
they at once spotted two huge slabs of stone blocking its entrance. “This has to be where
the monstrous deviate is,” said the local spirit. “She must have crawled in there to evade
your pursuit.” Pilgrim lifted away the stones with his iron rod. The monstrous deviate
was indeed hiding in there. With a loud whoosh, she leaped out and attacked with
upraised pestle. Pilgrim wielded his iron rod to parry the blow, so terrifying the two
deities that the mountain god backed up and the local spirit darted away. “Who asked
you two,” whined the monster to the two of them, “to bring him here to look for me?”
Barely able to withstand the iron rod, she fought as she retreated, rising to
midair.
It was getting late, and the situation became more precarious. Growing more and
more violent, Pilgrim was about to give her the coup de grace. Suddenly a voice rang
out from the azure air of the Ninefold Heaven:
“Great Sage, don't raise your hand! Don't raise your hand! Be lenient with your
rod!” Pilgrim turned to look and discovered the Star Lord of Supreme Yin, followed by
the immortal Chang'e and other lunar goddesses, all descending in front of him on a
pink cloud. Pilgrim was so startled that he quickly put away his iron rod and bowed to
receive them, saying, “Old Supreme Yin, where are you going? Pardon old Monkey for
not stepping out of the way!”
“The monstrous deviate opposing you,” said Supreme Yin, “happens to be the
jade hare of my Vast-Cold Palace, the one who helps me pound the immortal drug of
1251
1251
mysterious frost. On her own she picked open the gold lock and jade bolt and fled the
palace for a year.
I calculated that she might be in mortal danger at this moment, and that's why I
have come to save her life. I beg the Great Sage to spare her for this old man's sake.”
“Yes! Yes! Yes!” said Pilgrim. “I dare not refuse you, of course! No wonder she
knows how to use a pestle for herbs! So, she is the little jade hare! But I wonder
whether the old Supreme Yin knows of her kidnapping the princess of the Kingdom of
India. She speciously assumed the form of the princess in order to ruin the primal yang
of a sage monk, my master. Her desire and her offense are really intolerable. How could
she be spared so lightly?”
“You have no knowledge of this either,” said Supreme Yin. “The daughter of the
king is no ordinary mortal. Originally she was the Lady White of the Toad Palace.
Eighteen years ago, after giving a slap to the little jade hare, she was overcome by
mortal longings and went to the Region Below. The light of her soul found conception
in the belly of the queen, and she was born to the royal family.
Nursing the grudge of that single slap, this little jade hare ran away from our
palace last year so that she could send Lady White into the wilds. But she should not
have wanted to marry the Tang Monk, and this offense is certainly unforgivable.
Fortunately you were alert enough to discern the true and the false, so that she did not
have a chance to ruin your master. I beg you, therefore, to pardon her for my sake. I'll
take her back now.”
“When you present me with this sort of karma,” said Pilgrim, chuckling, “old
Monkey dares not go against your wishes. But if you take away the little jade hare now,
I fear that the king may not believe me. I hope, therefore, that Lord Supreme Yin and
my immortal sisters will take the trouble of bringing the little jade hare to the kingdom
and giving a clear testimony. In that way, not only the ability of old Monkey will be
made known, but the reason for the descent of Lady White can also be told. Then we
may ask the king to send for Princess Lady White, so that the purpose of manifest
retribution may be clearly established.”
Consenting to what he said, Lord Supreme Yin pointed at the monstrous deviate
and snapped, “Cursed beast! Aren't you returning to what is right?” Rolling over on the
ground, the little jade hare revealed her true form. Truly she has
Sharp teeth and divided lips,
Long ears with little hair.
Her body is a ball of furlike jade;
She can fly through mountains with paws outstretched.
The creamy straight nose
Seems brightly frosted or thickly powdered;
The shining red eyes
Can rival e'en white snow dotted with rouge.
Hugging the ground,
She's all fleecy like a bundle of silk;
Torso stretched out,
She's argent like a silver-threaded frame.
A number of times
She drinks at dawn the clear dew of Heaven's air,
And pounds long-life drug with a jade pestle rare.
1252
1252
Delighted by the sight, the Great Sage trod the cloudy luminosity, leading the
way, followed by Lord Supreme Yin, Chang'e and other lunar goddesses, and the jade
hare.
They arrived at the Kingdom of India about dusk, and the moon was just rising.
When they neared the city, they could hear the roll of drums on the watchtower. The
king and the Tang Monk were still in the main hall, while Eight Rules and Sha Monk,
along with many officials at the foot of the steps, were discussing the cessation of court.
They saw a glowing sheen of colored mists approaching from due south, its luminosity
making the whole place bright as day. As they stared into the sky, they heard the Great
Sage Sun crying out in a loud voice:
“Your Majesty of India, please ask your queen and concubines to come out and
look. Beneath this treasure canopy is the Star Lord of Supreme Yin, and the immortal
sisters on both sides of him are the lunar goddesses and Chang'e. This little jade hare is
the false princess of your household; she has now revealed her true form.”
The king hurriedly assembled the queen, his concubines, the palace maidens,
and gaily-attired girls to bow to the sky and worship.
He himself and the Tang Monk also expressed their thanks toward the sky by
bowing low. All the households in the city also set up incense tables and kowtowed,
chanting the name of Buddha.
As they looked up into the air, Zhu Eight Rules was moved to lust. Unable to
contain himself, he leaped into the air and embraced a rainbow-skirted immortal, crying,
“Sister, you and I are old acquaintances! Let's go play!” Walking forward to grab hold
of him, Pilgrim gave him a couple of slaps on the face and a scolding. “You vulgar
Idiot!” he said.
“Where do you think you are, that you dare vent your lust?”
“It's just a bit of slapstick,” replied Eight Rules, “to dispel my boredom and
have some fun! That's all!”
That Lord Supreme Yin ordered the entourage to turn. With the goddesses, they
took the jade hare back to the Lunar Palace, while Pilgrim yanked Eight Rules back to
the ground.
After thanking Pilgrim in the main hall, the king asked, “Since the false princess
has been captured by the mighty magic power of the divine monk, where is our true
princess to be found?”
“That true princess of yours,” replied Pilgrim, “did not come from mortal stock
either. She was actually the immortal Lady White of the Lunar Palace. Because she
slapped the jade hare once eighteen years ago, she thought of this world and descended
to the Region Below, where she was conceived in your queen, who gave birth to her.
Nursing this former enmity, the little jade hare last year picked open the jade bolt and
gold lock and escaped to this place also. She kidnapped the Lady White and left her in
the wilds before assuming her form to deceive you. This entire karmic process was told
to me personally by Lord Supreme Yin himself. Today the false one has been removed;
tomorrow you will be asked to go search for the real one.” On hearing this, the king
became both embarrassed and alarmed, hardly able to hold back the tears flowing down
his cheeks.
1253
1253
“Child!” he said. “Since I was enthroned in my youth, I have never even left the
gate of the city. Where should I go look for you?” With a smile, Pilgrim said, “No need
to be upset. Right now your princess is feigning madness at the Benefactor-of-Orphans
Gold- Spreading Monastery. Let's retire. By morning I promise you I'll return your true
princess.”
The other officials, too, prostrated themselves and said, “Let our king put his
worries to rest. These several divine monks are buddhas who are able to soar on the
clouds and ride the fog. Most certainly they possess the knowledge of past and future.
Let the divine monks go make a search tomorrow, and undoubtedly they will get to the
end of the matter.”
The king agreed, and ordered the pilgrims again taken to the Spring-Detaining
Arbor for their meals and lodging. By then it was almost the hour of the second watch.
Truly
The moon is fair, the copper pots mark their times
As wind wafts the tinklings of golden chimes.
Spring has half faded and the nightjars weep;
Petals shroud the path for the night is deep.
An idle swing the royal garden shades;
silver stream a jade-blue sky invades.
None walks the streets or visits the bazaars
When night's aglow with a sky full of stars.
They all rested that night, and we shall leave them for the moment.
Because his demonic aura had been dispelled, the king's energy revived during
the night. By the third quarter of the fifth watch, he appeared again to hold his morning
court, after which he asked for the Tang Monk and his three disciples to come and
discuss the matter of finding his daughter. The elder arrived and greeted him, while the
Great Sage and his two brothers also bowed. Returning their bows, the king said, “We
spoke of our child, the princess, yesterday. May I trouble the divine monks to look for
her?”
The elder said, “The day before your humble cleric came from the East, by
nightfall we had entered a Benefactor-of-Orphans Gold- Spreading Monastery to ask for
lodging. The priests there were good enough to accommodate our request. After dinner
we took a stroll in the moonlight to go to look at the foundation of the old GoldSpreading garden. Suddenly we heard the sound of lament. When we inquired into the
matter, a priest of the monastery, who was already over one hundred years of age, sent
away his attendants and told us, „This is the source of that lament:
Late spring last year, I was just meditating on the dialectical relation of the
moon and our nature when a breeze brought to me the sounds of weeping and lament.
When I arose from my mat and went down to the foundation of the Jetavana garden to
look, I found a girl. On being questioned, she told me that she was the daughter of the
King of India, blown to that place by a strong gust when she was enjoying the sight of
flowers in the moonlight.' Since that old priest was quite knowledgeable in human
propriety, he locked the princess in a quiet room. Fearing that she might be defiled by
other priests in the monastery, he only told them that a monster-spirit had been locked
up by him. The princess, too, understood his intentions; during the day she would
babble absurdities just to win some sustenance of tea and rice for herself. During the
night, however, with no one present, she would think of her parents and weep. That old
1254
1254
priest had journeyed to the capital several times to try to ascertain the truth. When he
learned that the princess, to all appearance, was in the palace and unharmed, he dared
not present a memorial on the matter. When he learned, however, that my disciple had
some magic powers, he urged us repeatedly to make a thorough investigation. Little did
we expect that the jade hare of the Toad Palace had become a monster and, falsely fused
with the true form, had taken on the appearance of the princess. The monster, moreover,
was hoping to ruin my primal yang, and it was fortunate that my disciple exercised his
magic power to distinguish the true from the specious. Now the hare has been taken
back by the Star of Supreme Yin, but your worthy daughter may still be seen feigning
madness at the Gold-Spreading Monastery.” When the king heard this meticulous
account, he gave voice to loud weeping, so disturbing those in three palaces and six
chambers that they arrived to make inquiry. When they learned of the cause, everyone
wept profusely. After a long while, the king asked again, “How far is the GoldSpreading Monastery from the city?”
“No more than sixty miles,” replied Tripitaka.
The king at once issued this decree:
“Let the consorts of the East and the West Palaces guard the main hall, while the
court's Grand Preceptor will defend the kingdom. We and the queen herself will take
the many officials and the four divine monks to the monastery and bring our princess
home.” Immediately carriages were lined up and they all went out of the court. Look at
that Pilgrim! He leaped into the air and, with one twist of his torso, arrived at the
monastery before them. The priests there hurriedly knelt down to receive him, saying,
“When the Venerable Father left, he walked with the rest of his companions. Why did
you descend from the sky today?”
“Where is that old master of yours?” asked Pilgrim, laughing. “Ask him to come
out quickly, so that you may set up incense tables to receive the royal carriage. The king
and queen of India, along with many officials and my master, are about to arrive.”
The various monks could not quite comprehend what he was saying, and they
asked the old priest to come out.
When the old priest caught sight of Pilgrim, he bent low and said, “Venerable
Father, what have you found out about the princess?”
Thereupon Pilgrim gave a thorough rehearsal of how the false princess tossed an
embroidered ball to try to wed the Tang Monk, how he fought and chased her, and how
Lord Supreme Yin appeared to take away the jade hare. The old priest again kowtowed
to express his thanks.
Raising him with his hands, Pilgrim said, “Stop bowing! Stop bowing! Prepare
quickly to receive the imperial carriage.” Only then did those priests discover that a girl
had been locked up in the back room. In amazement, they all went to help set up incense
tables beyond the monastery gate. After putting on the cassocks, they began to toll the
bells and roll the drums as they waited. In a little while the imperial carriage did indeed
arrive. Truly
Auspicious mists and fragrance fill the sky
When to this rustic temple Grace draws nigh—
Like a timeless rainbow cleansing streams and seas,
Like springtime lightnings of sage kings' dynasties.
Such kindness the sylvan beauty advances;
1255
1255
moisture the wild floral scent enhances.
For relics left by an ancient elder,
This precious hall receives a wise ruler.
The king reached the monastery gate and was met outside by those monks in
orderly rows. They all prostrated themselves to receive him. Then he saw Pilgrim
standing in their midst.
“How did the divine monk manage to get here first?” asked the king.
“Old Monkey arrived here with a mere twist of his torso!” said Pilgrim,
chuckling. “Why did you people take half a day to do it?”
Thereafter the Tang Monk and the others arrived. With the elder leading the
way, they went to the room at the back of the monastery, where they found the princess
still babbling and feigning madness. Going to his knees, the old priest pointed to the
room and said, “Inside this room is the lady princess who was blown here last year by
the wind.”
The king at once ordered the door opened, and they removed the iron lock from
the door. When the king and queen caught sight of the princess and recognized her face,
they rushed forward to embrace her, not at all bothered by the filth. “Our poor child!”
they cried.
“What bitter fate has caused you to suffer like this here!”
Truly the reunion of parents and child is not the same as any other kind of
reunion. The three of them hugged each other and wailed. After they had cried for a
while and had given expression to how greatly they missed each other, the king ordered
scented liquid to be sent in for the princess so that she could bathe and change her
clothing.
They then climbed onto the imperial chariot together to return to the capital.
Afterward Pilgrim greeted the king once more with hands folded in front of him
and said, “Old Monkey has another matter to bring to your attention.” Returning his
greeting, the king said, “We shall obey whatever instruction the divine monk has for
us.” Pilgrim said, “They told me that in your mountain here, the one named HundredLegs, there are centipedes that have become spirits recently and have harmed people
during the night. The travelers and merchants have found that a great inconvenience.
Since roosters are the natural foes of centipedes, I think you should select a thousand
huge roosters and scatter them throughout the mountain so that these poisonous insects
will be eliminated. You should change the name of this mountain also, and you should
bestow a building decree to this monastery as a token of your gratitude for this monk's
care for the princess.”
Exceedingly pleased, the king immediately sent officials into the city to fetch the
roosters. The name of the mountain was changed to Precious Flower. The Bureau of
Labor was told to provide the necessary materials for the repair and renovation of the
monastery, and its name was changed to the Royal Benefactor-of-Orphans GoldSpreading Monastery of the Precious Flower Mountain. The priest was appointed a
monk-official, with the perpetual title of Patriotic and an official salary of thirty-six
stones. The monks, after giving thanks, saw the imperial carriage return to court, where
the princess entered the various palaces to be reunited with her kinfolk.

Large banquets were prepared for celebrating her homecoming and reunion with
her family. The king and his subjects also joined in the revelry, drinking and feasting all
evening.
The next morning the king issued the decree for portraits to be made of the four
sage monks and mounted in the Chinese and Barbarian Loft. The princess, with fresh
clothing and makeup, was asked to come out to thank the Tang Monk and his three
disciples once more for her deliverance. After that, the Tang Monk wanted to take leave
of the king to journey westward, but the king, of course, refused to let them go. Again
they were feted for five or six days, thus providing excellent opportunities for our Idiot
to stuff himself repeatedly.
When the king saw, however, how eager they were in their desire to worship
Buddha, rejecting all entreaties for them to stay, he presented them with two hundred
ingots of gold and silver and a platter of treasures. Master and disciples refused to take
even a penny.
The king then ordered the imperial carriage for the old master to ride in and
many officials to escort him to a great distance. The queen, the concubines, the officials,
and the people all kowtowed without ceasing to express their thanks. When they
reached the outskirts of the city, they saw the priests of the temple, too, had come to
bow and see them off, reluctant to take leave of the pilgrims. When Pilgrim saw that all
the people were unwilling to turn back, he had no choice but to make the magic sign
with his fingers and blew a mouthful of immortal breath toward the ground on the
southwest. Immediately a gust of dark wind blinded the people's eyes, and only then
could the pilgrims proceed. Truly,
Cleansed by gracious waves to return to revealing cause,
They left the sea of gold to awake to the true void.
We do not know what the journey ahead was like; let's listen to the explanation
in the next chapter.
