        <p>
            Now we were speaking of the Handsome Monkey King's triumphant return to
            his home country. After slaying the Monstrous King of Havoc and wresting from him
            his huge scimitar, he practiced daily with the little monkeys the art of war, teaching
            them how to sharpen bamboos for making spears, file wood for making swords, arrange
            flags and banners, go on patrol, advance or retreat, and pitch camp.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a long time he played thus with them. Suddenly he grew quiet and sat down,
            thinking out loud to himself, <em>"The game we are playing here may turn out to be
                something quite serious. Suppose we disturb the rulers of humans or of fowls and
                beasts, and they become offended; suppose they say that these military exercises of ours
                are subversive, and raise an army to destroy us. How can we meet them with our
                bamboo spears and wooden swords? We must have sharp swords and fine halberds. But
                what can be done at this moment?"</em> When the monkeys heard this, they were all
            alarmed. <em>"The great king's observation is very sound,"</em> they said, <em>"but where can we
                obtain these things?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            As they were speaking, four older monkeys came forward, two female monkeys
            with red buttocks and two bareback gibbons. Coming to the front, they said, <em>"Great
                King, to be furnished with sharp-edged weapons is a very simple matter."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"How is it simple?"</em> asked Wukong. The four monkeys replied, <em>"East of our
                mountain, across two hundred miles of water, is the boundary of the Aolai Country. In
                that country there is a king who has numberless men and soldiers in his city, and there
                are bound to be all kinds of metalworks there. If the great king goes there, he can either
                buy weapons or have them made. Then you can teach us how to use them for the
                protection of our mountain, and this will be the stratagem for assuring ourselves of
                perpetuity."</em> When Wukong heard this, he was filled with delight. <em>"Play here, all of
                you,"</em> he said. <em>"Let me make a trip."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Dear Monkey King! He quickly performed his cloud somersault and crossed the
            two hundred miles of water in no time. On the other side he did indeed discover a city
            with broad streets and huge marketplaces, countless houses and numerous arches. Under
            the clear sky and bright sun, people were coming and going constantly. Wukong
            thought to himself, <em>"There must be ready-made weapons around here. But going down
                there to buy a few pieces from them is not as good a bargain as acquiring them by
                magic."</em>
                </p><p>
            He therefore made the magic sign and recited a spell. Facing the ground on the
            southwest, he took a deep breath and then blew it out. At once it became a mighty wind,
            hurtling pebbles and rocks through the air. It was truly terrifying:
            </p>
            <blockquote><em>
            Thick clouds in vast formation moved o'er the world;<br>
            Black fog and dusky vapor darkened the Earth;<br>
            Waves churned in seas and rivers, affrighting fishes and crabs;<br>
            Boughs broke in mountain forests, wolves and tigers taking flight.<br>
            Traders and merchants were gone from stores and shops.<br>
            No single man was seen at sundry marts and malls.<br>
            The king retreated to his chamber from the royal court.<br>
            Officials, martial and civil, returned to their homes.<br>
            This wind toppled Buddha's throne of a thousand years<br>
            And shook to its foundations the Five- Phoenix Tower.</em></blockquote>
            <p>
            The wind arose and separated the king from his subjects in the Aolai Country.
            Throughout the various boulevards and marketplaces, every family bolted the doors and
            windows and no one dared go outside. Wukong then lowered the direction of his cloud
            and rushed straight through the imperial gate. He found his way to the armory, knocked
            open the doors, and saw that there were countless weapons inside. Scimitars, spears,
            swords, halberds, battle-axes, scythes, whips, rakes, drumsticks, drums, bows, arrows,
            forks, and lances— every kind was available. Highly pleased, Wukong said to himself,
            <em>"How many pieces can I possibly carry by myself? I'd better use the magic of body
                division to transport them."</em>
                </p><p>
            Dear Monkey King! He plucked a handful of hairs, chewed them to pieces in his
            mouth, and spat them out. Reciting the spell, he cried, <em>"Change!"</em>
            </p><p>
            They changed into thousands of little monkeys, who snatched and grabbed the
            weapons. Those that were stronger took six or seven pieces, the weaker ones two or
            three pieces, and together they emptied out the armory. Wukong then mounted the cloud
            and performed the magic of displacement by calling up a great wind, which carried all
            the little monkeys back to their home.
            </p><p>
            When the monkeys saw the wind, they were all frightened and ran to hide. The
            We tell you now about the various monkeys, both great and small, who were
            playing outside the cave of the Flower-Fruit Mountain.
            </p><p>
            They suddenly heard the sound of wind and saw in midair a huge horde of
            monkeys approaching, the sight of which made them all flee in terror and hide. In a
            moment, Wukong lowered his cloud and, shaking himself, collected the pieces of hair
            back onto his body. All the weapons were piled in front of the mountain. <em>"Little ones,"</em>
            he shouted, <em>"come and receive your weapons!"</em>
            </p><p>
            The monkeys looked and saw Wukong standing alone on level ground. They
            came running to kowtow and ask what had happened. Wukong then recounted to them
            how he had made use of the mighty wind to transport the weapons. After expressing
            their gratitude, the monkeys all went to grab at the scimitars and snatch at the swords, to
            wield the axes and scramble for spears, to stretch the bows and mount the arrows.
            </p><p>
            Shouting and screaming, they played all day long.
            The following day, they marched in formation as usual. Assembling the
            monkeys, Wukong found that there were forty-seven thousand of them. This assembly
            greatly impressed all the wild beasts of the mountain—wolves, insects, tigers, leopards,
            mouse deer, fallow deer, river deer, foxes, wild cats, badgers, lions, elephants, apes,
            bears, antelopes, boars, muskoxen, chamois, green one-horn buffaloes, wild hares, and
            giant mastiffs. Led by the various demon kings of no fewer than seventy-two caves,
            they all came to pay homage to the Monkey King. Henceforth they brought annual
            tributes and answered the roll call made every season. Some of them joined in the
            maneuvers; others supplied provisions in accordance with their rank. In an orderly
            fashion, they made the entire Flower- Fruit Mountain as strong as an iron bucket or a
            city of metal. The various demon kings also presented metal drums, colored banners,
            and helmets. The hurly-burly of marching and drilling went on day after day.
            While the Handsome Monkey King was enjoying all this, he suddenly said to
            the multitude, <em>"You all have become adept with the bow and arrow and proficient in the
                38
                38
                use of weapons. But this scimitar of mine is truly cumbersome, not at all to my liking.
                What can I do?"</em>
            The four elder monkeys came forward and memorialized, <em>"The great king is a
                divine sage, and therefore it is not fit for him to use an earthly weapon. We do not
                know, however, whether the great king is able to take a journey through water?"</em>
            <em>"Since I have known the Way,"</em> said Wukong, <em>"I have the ability of seventy-two
                transformations. The cloud somersault has unlimited power. I am familiar with the
                magic of body concealment and the magic of displacement. I can find my way to
                Heaven or I can enter the Earth. I can walk past the sun and the moon without casting a
                shadow, and I can penetrate stone and metal without hindrance. Water cannot drown
                me, nor fire burn me. Is there any place I can't go to?"</em>
            <em>"It's a good thing that the great king possesses such powers,"</em> said the four
            monkeys, <em>"for the water below this sheet iron bridge of ours flows directly into the
                Dragon Palace of the Eastern Ocean. If you are willing to go down there, Great King,
                you will find the old Dragon King, from whom you may request some kind of weapon.
                Won't that be to your liking?"</em>
            Hearing this, Wukong said with delight, <em>"Let me make the trip!"</em>
            Dear Monkey King! He jumped to the bridgehead and employed the magic of
            water restriction. Making the magic sign with his fingers, he leaped into the waves,
            which parted for him, and he followed the waterway straight to the bottom of the
            Eastern Ocean. As he was walking, he suddenly ran into a yakṣa on patrol, who stopped
            him with the question, <em>"What divine sage is this who comes pushing through the water?
                Speak plainly so that I can announce your arrival."</em> Wukong said, <em>"I am the Heavenborn sage Sun
                Wukong of the
                Flower-Fruit Mountain, a near neighbor of your old
                Dragon King. How is it that you don't recognize me?"</em> When the yakṣa heard this, he
            hurried back to the Water-Crystal Palace to report. <em>"Great King,"</em> he said, <em>"there is
                outside a Heaven-born sage of the Flower-Fruit Mountain named Sun Wukong. He
                claims that he is a near neighbor of yours, and he is about to arrive at the palace."</em>
            Aoguang, the Dragon King of the Eastern Ocean, arose immediately;
            accompanied by dragon sons and grandsons, shrimp soldiers and crab generals, he came
            out for the reception. <em>"High Immortal,"</em> he said, <em>"please come in!"</em>
            They went into the palace for proper introduction, and after offering Wukong the
            honored seat and tea, the king asked, <em>"When did the high immortal become
                accomplished in the Way, and what kind of divine magic did he receive?"</em> Wukong said,
            <em>"Since the time of my birth, I have left the family to practice self-cultivation. I have
                now acquired a birthless and deathless body. Recently I have been teaching my children
                how to protect our mountain cave, but unfortunately I am without an appropriate
                weapon. I have heard that my noble neighbor, who has long enjoyed living in this
                green-jade palace and its shell portals, must have many divine weapons to spare. I came
                specifically to ask for one of them."</em> When the Dragon King heard this, he could hardly
            refuse. So he ordered a perch commander to bring out a long-handled scimitar, and
            presented it to his visitor. <em>"Old Monkey doesn't know how to use a scimitar,"</em> said
            Wukong. <em>"I beg you to give me something else."</em>
            The Dragon King then commanded a whiting lieutenant together with an eel
            porter to carry out a nine-pronged fork. Jumping down from his seat, Wukong took hold
            of it and tried a few thrusts. He put it down, saying, <em>"Light! Much too light! And it
                doesn't suit my hand. I beg you to give me another one."</em>
            39
            39
            <em>"High Immortal,"</em> said the Dragon King, laughing, <em>"won't you even take a closer
                look? This fork weighs three thousand six hundred pounds."</em>
            <em>"It doesn't suit my hand,"</em> Wukong said, <em>"it doesn't suit my hand!"</em>
            The Dragon King was becoming rather fearful; he ordered a bream admiral and
            a carp brigadier to carry out a giant halberd, weighing seven thousand two hundred
            pounds. When he saw this, Wukong ran forward and took hold of it. He tried a few
            thrusts and parries and then stuck it in the ground, saying, <em>"It's still light! Much too
                light!"</em>
            The old Dragon King was completely unnerved. <em>"High Immortal,"</em> he said,
            <em>"there's no weapon in my palace heavier than this halberd."</em> Laughing, Wukong said,
            <em>"As the old saying goes, „Who worries about the Dragon King's lacking treasures!' Go
                and look some more, and if you find something I like, I'll offer you a good price."</em>
            <em>"There really aren't any more here,"</em> said the Dragon King.
            As they were speaking, the dragon mother and her daughter slipped out and said,
            <em>"Great King, we can see that this is definitely not a sage with meager abilities. Inside
                our ocean treasury is that piece of rare magic iron by which the depth of the Heavenly
                River is fixed.
                These past few days the iron has been glowing with a strange and lovely light.
                Could this be a sign that it should be taken out to meet this sage?"</em>
            <em>"That,"</em> said the Dragon King, <em>"was the measure with which the Great Yu fixed
                the depths of rivers and oceans when he conquered the Flood. It's a piece of magic iron,
                but of what use could it be to him?"</em>
            <em>"Let's not be concerned with whether he could find any use for it,"</em> said the
            dragon mother. <em>"Let's give it to him, and he can do whatever he wants with it. The
                important thing is to get him out of this palace!"</em>
            The old Dragon King agreed and told Wukong the whole story. <em>"Take it out and
                let me see it,"</em> said Wukong.
            Waving his hands, the Dragon King said, <em>"We can't move it! We can't even lift
                it! The high immortal must go there himself to take a look."</em>
            <em>"Where is it?"</em> asked Wukong. <em>"Take me there."</em>
            The Dragon King accordingly led him to the center of the ocean treasury, where
            all at once they saw a thousand shafts of golden light. Pointing to the spot, the Dragon
            King said, <em>"That's it—the thing that is glowing."</em> Wukong girded up his clothes and
            went forward to touch it: it was an iron rod more than twenty feet long and as thick as a
            barrel. Using all his might, he lifted it with both hands, saying, <em>"It's a little too long and
                too thick. It would be more serviceable if it were somewhat shorter and thinner."</em>
            Hardly had he finished speaking when the treasure shrunk a few feet in length
            and became a layer thinner. <em>"Smaller still would be even better,"</em> said Wukong, giving it
            another bounce in his hands. Again the treasure became smaller. Highly pleased,
            Wukong took it out of the ocean treasury to examine it. He found a golden hoop at each
            end, with solid black iron in between. Immediately adjacent to one of the hoops was the
            inscription, <em>"The Compliant Golden-Hooped Rod. Weight: thirteen thousand five
                hundred pounds."</em>
            40
            40
            He thought to himself in secret delight, <em>"This treasure, I suppose, must be most
                compliant with one's wishes."</em>
            As he walked, he was deliberating in his mind and murmuring to himself,
            bouncing the rod in his hands, <em>"Shorter and thinner still would be marvelous!"</em>
            By the time he took it outside, the rod was no more than twenty feet in length
            and had the thickness of a rice bowl.
            See how he displayed his power now! He wielded the rod to make lunges and
            passes, engaging in mock combat all the way back to the Water-Crystal Palace. The old
            Dragon King was so terrified that he shook with fear, and the dragon princes were all
            panic-stricken.
            Sea-turtles and tortoises drew in their necks; fishes, shrimps, and crabs all hid
            themselves. Wukong held the treasure in his hands and sat in the Water-Crystal Palace.
            Laughing, he said to the Dragon King, <em>"I am indebted to my good neighbor for his
                profound kindness."</em>
            <em>"Please don't mention it,"</em> said the Dragon King. <em>"This piece of iron is very
                useful,"</em> said Wukong, <em>"but I have one further statement to make."</em>
            <em>"What sort of statement does the high immortal wish to make?"</em> asked the
            Dragon King. Wukong said, <em>"Had there been no such iron, I would have let the matter
                drop. Now that I have it in my hands, I can see that I am wearing the wrong kind of
                clothes to go with it. What am I to do? If you have any martial apparel, you might as
                well give me some too. I would thank you most heartily."</em>
            <em>"This, I confess, is not in my possession,"</em> said the Dragon King. Wukong said,
            <em>"A solitary guest will not disturb two hosts. Even if you claim that you don't have any, I
                shall never walk out of this door."</em>
            <em>"Let the high immortal take the trouble of going to another ocean,"</em> said the
            Dragon King. <em>"He might turn up something there."</em>
            <em>"To visit three homes is not as convenient as sitting in one,"</em> said Wukong, <em>"I
                beg you to give me one outfit."</em>
            <em>"I really don't have one,"</em> said the Dragon King, <em>"for if I did, I would have
                presented it to you."</em>
            <em>"Is that so?"</em> said Wukong. <em>"Let me try the iron on you!"</em>
            <em>"High Immortal,"</em> the Dragon King said nervously, <em>"don't ever raise your hand!
                Don't ever raise your hand! Let me see whether my brothers have any and we'll try to
                give you one."</em>
            <em>"Where are your honored brothers?"</em> asked Wukong. <em>"They are,"</em> said the
            Dragon King, <em>"Aoqin, Dragon King of the Southern Ocean; Aoshun, Dragon King of
                the Northern Ocean; and Aorun, Dragon King of the Western Ocean."</em>
            <em>"Old Monkey is not going to their places,"</em> said Wukong. <em>"For as the common
                saying goes, „Three in bond can't compete with two in hand.' I'm merely requesting
                that you find something casual here and give it to me. That's all."</em>
            <em>"There's no need for the high immortal to go anywhere,"</em> said the Dragon King.
            <em>"I have in my palace an iron drum and a golden bell. Whenever there is any emergency,
                we beat the drum and strike the bell and my brothers are here shortly."</em>
            41
            41
            <em>"In that case,"</em> said Wukong, <em>"go beat the drum and strike the bell."</em>
            The turtle general went at once to strike the bell, while the tortoise marshal came
            to beat the drum.
            Soon after the drum and the bell had sounded, the Dragon Kings of the Three
            Oceans got the message and arrived promptly, all congregating in the outer courtyard.
            <em>"Elder Brother,"</em> said Aoqin, <em>"what emergency made you beat the drum and strike the
                bell?"</em>
            <em>"Good Brother,"</em> answered the old Dragon, <em>"it's a long story! We have here a
                certain Heaven-born sage from the Flower-Fruit Mountain, who came here and claimed
                to be my near neighbor. He subsequently demanded a weapon; the steel fork I presented
                he deemed too small, and the halberd I offered too light. Finally he himself took that
                piece of rare, divine iron by which the depth of the Heavenly River was fixed and used
                it for mock combat. He is now sitting in the palace and also demanding some sort of
                battle dress.
                We have none of that here. So we sounded the drum and the bell to invite you all
                to come. If you happen to have some such outfit, please give it to him so that I can send
                him out of this door!"</em> When Aoqin heard this, he was outraged. <em>"Let us brothers call
                our army together,"</em> he said, <em>"and arrest him. What's wrong with that?"</em>
            <em>"Don't talk about arresting him!"</em> the old Dragon said, <em>"don't talk about
                arresting him! That piece of iron—a small stroke with it is deadly and a light tap is
                fatal! The slightest touch will crack the skin and a small rap will injure the muscles!"</em>
            Aorun, the Dragon King of the Western Ocean, said, <em>"Second elder brother
                should not raise his hand against him. Let us rather assemble an outfit for him and get
                him out of this place. We can then present a formal complaint to Heaven, and Heaven
                will send its own punishment."</em>
            <em>"You are right,"</em> said Aoshun, the Dragon King of the Northern Ocean, <em>"I have
                here a pair of cloud-treading shoes the color of lotus root."</em>
            Aorun, the Dragon King of the Western Ocean said, <em>"I brought along a cuirass
                of chain-mail made of yellow gold."</em>
            <em>"And I have a cap with erect phoenix plumes, made of red gold,"</em> said Aoqin, the
            Dragon King of the Southern Ocean. The old Dragon King was delighted and brought
            them into the Water-Crystal Palace to present the gifts. Wukong duly put on the gold
            cap, the gold cuirass, and cloud-treading shoes, and, wielding his compliant rod, he
            fought his way out in mock combat, yelling to the dragons, <em>"Sorry to have bothered
                you!"</em>
            The Dragon Kings of the Four Oceans were outraged, and they consulted
            together about filing a formal complaint, of which we make no mention here.
            Look at that Monkey King! He opened up the waterway and went straight back
            to the head of the sheet iron bridge. The four old monkeys were leading the other
            monkeys and waiting beside the bridge. They suddenly beheld Wukong leaping out of
            the waves: there was not a drop of water on his body as he walked onto the bridge, all
            radiant and golden. The various monkeys were so astonished that they all knelt down,
            crying, <em>"Great King, what marvels! What marvels!"</em>
            Beaming broadly, Wukong ascended his high throne and set up the iron rod right
            in the center. Not knowing any better, the monkeys all came and tried to pick the
            42
            42
            treasure up. It was rather like a dragonfly attempting to shake an ironwood tree: they
            could not budge it an inch! Biting their fingers and sticking out their tongues, every one
            of them said, <em>"O Father, it's so heavy! How did you ever manage to bring it here?"</em>
            Wukong walked up to the rod, stretched forth his hands, and picked it up. Laughing, he
            said to them, <em>"Everything has its owner. This treasure has presided in the ocean treasury
                for who knows how many thousands of years, and it just happened to glow recently.
                The Dragon King only recognized it as a piece of black iron, though it is also said to be
                the divine rarity which fixed the bottom of the Heavenly River. All those fellows
                together could not lift or move it, and they asked me to take it myself. At first, this
                treasure was more than twenty feet long and as thick as a barrel.
                After I struck it once and expressed my feeling that it was too large, it grew
                smaller. I wanted it smaller still, and again it grew smaller.
                For a third time I commanded it, and it grew smaller still! When I looked at it in
                the light, it had on it the inscription, „The Compliant Golden-Hooped Rod. Weight:
                thirteen thousand five hundred pounds.' Stand aside, all of you. Let me ask it to go
                through some more transformations."</em>
            He held the treasure in his hands and called out, <em>"Smaller, smaller, smaller!"</em> and
            at once it shrank to the size of a tiny embroidery needle, small enough to be hidden
            inside the ear. Awestruck, the monkeys cried, <em>"Great King! Take it out and play with it
                some more."</em>
            The Monkey King took it out from his ear and placed it on his palm. <em>"Bigger,
                bigger, bigger!"</em> he shouted, and again it grew to the thickness of a barrel and more than
            twenty feet long. He became so delighted playing with it that he jumped onto the bridge
            and walked out of the cave. Grasping the treasure in his hands, he began to perform the
            magic of cosmic imitation. Bending over, he cried, <em>"Grow!"</em> and at once grew to be ten
            thousand feet tall, with a head like the Tai Mountain and a chest like a rugged peak,
            eyes like lightning and a mouth like a blood bowl, and teeth like swords and halberds.
            The rod in his hands was of such a size that its top reached the thirty-third Heaven and
            its bottom the eighteenth layer of Hell. Tigers, leopards, wolves, and crawling creatures,
            all the monsters of the mountain and the demon kings of the seventy-two caves, were so
            terrified that they kowtowed and paid homage to the Monkey King in fear and
            trembling. Presently he revoked his magical appearance and changed the treasure back
            into a tiny embroidery needle stored in his ear. He returned to the cave dwelling, but the
            demon kings of the various caves were still frightened, and they continued to come to
            pay their respects.
            At this time, the banners were unfurled, the drums sounded, and the brass gongs
            struck loudly. A great banquet of a hundred delicacies was given, and the cups were
            filled to overflowing with the fruit of the vines and the juices of the coconut. They
            drank and feasted for a long time, and they engaged in military exercises as before. The
            Monkey King made the four old monkeys mighty commanders of his troops by
            appointing the two female monkeys with red buttocks as marshals Ma and Liu, and the
            two bareback gibbons as generals Beng and Ba. The four mighty commanders,
            moreover, were entrusted with all matters concerning fortification, pitching camps,
            reward, and punishment. Having settled all this, the Monkey King felt completely at
            ease to soar on the clouds and ride the mist, to tour the four seas and disport himself in a
            thousand mountains. Displaying his martial skill, he made extensive visits to various
            heroes and warriors; performing his magic, he made many good friends. At this time,
            moreover, he entered into fraternal alliance with six other monarchs: the Bull Monster
            43
            43
            King, the Dragon Monster King, the Garuda Monster King, the Giant Lynx King, the
            Macaque King, and the Orangutan King. Together with the Handsome Monkey King,
            they formed a fraternal order of seven. Day after day they discussed civil and military
            arts, exchanged wine cups and goblets, sang and danced to songs and strings. They
            gathered in the morning and parted in the evening; there was not a single pleasure that
            they overlooked, covering a distance of ten thousand miles as if it were but the span of
            their own courtyard. As the saying has it,
            One nod of the head goes farther than three thousand miles;
            One twist of the torso covers more than eight hundred.
            One day, the four mighty commanders had been told to prepare a great banquet
            in their own cave, and the six kings were invited to the feast. They killed cows and
            slaughtered horses; they sacrificed to Heaven and Earth. The various imps were ordered
            to dance and sing, and they all drank until they were thoroughly drunk. After sending
            the six kings off, Wukong also rewarded the leaders great and small with gifts.
            Reclining in the shade of pine trees near the sheet iron bridge, he fell asleep in a
            moment. The four mighty commanders led the crowd to form a protective circle around
            him, not daring to raise their voices. In his sleep the Handsome Monkey King saw two
            men approach with a summons with the three characters <em>"Sun Wukong"</em> written on it.
            They walked up to him and, without a word, tied him up with a rope and dragged him
            off. The soul of the Handsome Monkey King was reeling from side to side.
            They reached the edge of a city. The Monkey King was gradually coming to
            himself, when he lifted up his head and suddenly saw above the city an iron sign
            bearing in large letters the three words <em>"Region of Darkness."</em>
            The Handsome Monkey King at once became fully conscious. <em>"The Region of
                Darkness is the abode of Yama, King of Death,"</em> he said. <em>"Why am I here?"</em>
            <em>"Your age in the World of Life has come to an end,"</em> the two men said. <em>"The two
                of us were given this summons to arrest you."</em> When the Monkey King heard this, he
            said, <em>"I, old Monkey himself, have transcended the Three Regions and the Five Phases;
                hence I am no longer under Yama's jurisdiction. Why is he so confused that he wants to
                arrest me?"</em>
            The two summoners paid scant attention. Yanking and pulling, they were
            determined to haul him inside. Growing angry, the Monkey King whipped out his
            treasure. One wave of it turned it into the thickness of a rice bowl; he raised his hands
            once, and the two summoners were reduced to hash. He untied the rope, freed his hands,
            and fought his way into the city, wielding the rod. Bull-headed demons hid in terror, and
            horse-faced demons fled in every direction. A band of ghost soldiers ran up to the
            Palace of Darkness, crying, <em>"Great Kings! Disaster! Disaster! Outside there's a hairyfaced thunder god
                fighting his way in!"</em>
            Their report alarmed the Ten Kings of the Underworld so much that they quickly
            straightened out their attire and went out to see what was happening. Discovering a
            fierce and angry figure, they lined up according to their ranks and greeted him with loud
            voices:
            <em>"High Immortal, tell us your name. High Immortal, tell us your name."</em>
            <em>"I am the Heaven-born sage Sun Wukong from the Water-Curtain Cave in the
                Flower-Fruit Mountain,"</em> said the Monkey King, <em>"what kind of officials are you?"</em>
            44
            44
            <em>"We are the Emperors of Darkness,"</em> answered the Ten Kings, bowing, <em>"the Ten
                Kings of the Underworld."</em>
            <em>"Tell me each of your names at once,"</em> said Wukong, <em>"or I'll give you a
                drubbing."</em>
            The Ten Kings said, <em>"We are:
                King Qinguang, King of the Beginning River, King of the Song Emperor, King
                of Avenging Ministers, King Yama, King of Equal Ranks, King of the Tai Mountain,
                King of City Markets, King of the Complete Change, and King of the Turning Wheel."</em>
            <em>"Since you have all ascended the thrones of kingship,"</em> said Wukong, <em>"you
                should be intelligent beings, responsible in rewards and punishments. Why are you so
                ignorant of good and evil? Old Monkey has acquired the Dao and attained immortality.
                I enjoy the same age as Heaven, and I have transcended the Three Regions and leapt
                clear of the Five Phases. Why, then, did you send men to arrest me?"</em>
            <em>"High Immortal,"</em> said the Ten Kings, <em>"let your anger subside. There are many
                people in this world with the same name and surname. Couldn't the summoners have
                made a mistake?"</em>
            <em>"Nonsense! Nonsense!"</em> said Wukong. <em>"The proverb says, „Officials err, clerks
                err, but the summoner never errs!' Quick, bring out your register of births and deaths,
                and let me have a look."</em> When the Ten Kings heard this, they invited him to go into the
            palace to see for himself. Holding his compliant rod, Wukong went straight up to the
            Palace of Darkness and, facing south, sat down in the middle. The Ten Kings
            immediately had the judge in charge of the records bring out his books for examination.
            The judge, who did not dare tarry, hastened into a side room and brought out five or six
            books of documents and the ledgers on the ten species of living beings. He went through
            them one by one—shorthaired creatures, furry creatures, winged creatures, crawling
            creatures, and scaly creatures—but he did not find his name. He then proceeded to the
            file on monkeys. You see, though this monkey resembled a human being, he was not
            listed under the names of men; though he resembled the short-haired creatures, he did
            not dwell in their kingdoms; though he resembled other animals, he was not subject to
            the unicorn; and though he resembled flying creatures, he was not governed by the
            phoenix. He had, therefore, a separate ledger, which Wukong examined himself. Under
            the heading <em>"Soul 1350"</em> he found the name Sun Wukong recorded, with the
            description:
            <em>"Heaven-born Stone Monkey. Age: three hundred and forty-two years. A good
                end."</em> Wukong said, <em>"I really don't remember my age. All I want is to erase my name.
                Bring me a brush."</em>
            The judge hurriedly fetched the brush and soaked it in heavy ink. Wukong took
            the ledger on monkeys and crossed out all the names he could find in it. Throwing down
            the ledger, he said, <em>"That ends the account! That ends the account! Now I'm truly not
                your subject."</em>
            Brandishing his rod, he fought his way out of the Region of Darkness. The Ten
            Kings did not dare approach him. They went instead to the Green Cloud Palace to
            consult the Bodhisattva King Kṣitigarbha and made plans to report the incident to
            Heaven, which does not concern us for the moment.
            While our Monkey King was fighting his way out of the city, he was suddenly
            caught in a clump of grass and stumbled. Waking up with a start, he realized that it was
            45
            45
            all a dream. As he was stretching himself, he heard the four mighty commanders and the
            various monkeys crying with a loud voice, <em>"Great King! How much wine did you
                imbibe? You've slept all night long. Aren't you awake yet?"</em>
            <em>"Sleeping is nothing to get excited about,"</em> said Wukong, <em>"but I dreamed that
                two men came to arrest me, and I didn't perceive their intention until they brought me to
                the outskirts of the Region of Darkness. Showing my power, I protested right up to the
                Palace of Darkness and argued with the Ten Kings. I went through our ledger of births
                and deaths and crossed out all our names. Those fellows have no hold over us now."</em>
            The various monkeys all kowtowed to express their gratitude. From that time
            onward there were many mountain monkeys who did not grow old, for their names were
            not registered in the Underworld. When the Handsome Monkey King finished his
            account of what had happened, the four mighty commanders reported the story to the
            demon kings of various caves, who all came to tender their congratulations. Only a few
            days had passed when the six sworn brothers also came to congratulate him, all of them
            delighted about the cancellation of the names. We shall not elaborate here on their
            joyful gathering.
            We shall turn instead to the Great Benevolent Sage of Heaven, the Celestial Jade
            Emperor of the Most Venerable Deva, who was holding court one day in the Treasure
            Hall of Divine Mists, the Cloud Palace of Golden Arches. The divine ministers, civil
            and military, were just gathering for the morning session when suddenly the Daoist
            immortal Qiu Hongzhi announced, <em>"Your Majesty, outside the Translucent Palace,
                Aoguang, the Dragon King of the Eastern Ocean, is awaiting your command to present
                a memorial to the Throne."</em>
            The Jade Emperor gave the order to have him brought forth, and Aoguang was
            led into the Hall of Divine Mists. After he had paid his respects, a divine page boy in
            charge of documents received the memorial, and the Jade Emperor read it from the
            beginning. The memorial said:
            From the lowly water region of the Eastern Ocean at the East Pūrvavideha Continent, the small dragon
            subject, Aoguang, humbly informs the Wise Lord of Heaven, the Most Eminent High God and Ruler, that
            a bogus immortal, Sun Wukong, born of the Flower-Fruit Mountain and resident of the Water-Curtain
            Cave, has recently abused your small dragon, gaining a seat in his water home by force.
            He demanded a weapon, employing power and intimidation; he asked for martial attire, unleashing
            violence and threats. He terrorized my water kinsmen, and scattered turtles and tortoises. The Dragon of
            the Southern Ocean trembled; the Dragon of the Western Ocean was filled with horror; the Dragon of the
            Northern Ocean drew back his head to surrender; and your subject Aoguang flexed his body to do
            obeisance. We presented him with the divine treasure of an iron rod and the gold cap with phoenix
            plumes; giving him also a chain-mail cuirass and cloud-treading shoes, we sent him off courteously. But
            even then he was bent on displaying his martial prowess and magical powers, and all he could say to us
            was <em>"Sorry to have bothered you!"</em> We are indeed no match for him, nor are we able to subdue him.
            Your
            subject therefore presents this petition and humbly begs for imperial justice. We earnestly beseech you to
            dispatch the Heavenly host and capture this monster, so that tranquility may be restored to the oceans and
            prosperity to the Lower Region. Thus we present this memorial.
            When the Holy Emperor had finished reading, he gave the command:
            <em>"Let the Dragon God return to the ocean. We shall send our generals to arrest the
                culprit."</em>
            The old Dragon King gratefully touched his forehead to the ground and left.
            From below the Immortal Elder Ge, the Celestial Master, also brought forth the report.
            <em>"Your Majesty, the Minister of Darkness, King Qinguang, supported by the Bodhisattva
                King Kṣitigarbha, Pope of the Underworld, has arrived to present his memorial."</em>
            46
            46
            The jade girl in charge of communication came from the side to receive this
            document, which the Jade Emperor also read from the beginning. The memorial said:
            <em>"The Region of Darkness is the nether region proper to Earth. As Heaven is for gods and Earth for
                ghosts,
                so life and death proceed in cyclic succession. Fowls are born and animals die; male and female, they
                multiply. Births and transformations, the male begotten of the procreative female—such is the order of
                Nature, and it cannot be changed. But now appears Sun Wukong, a Heaven-born baneful monkey from
                the Water-Curtain Cave in the Flower-Fruit Mountain, who practices evil and violence, and resists our
                proper summons. Exercising magic powers, he utterly defeated the ghostly messengers of Ninefold
                Darkness; exploiting brute force, he terrorized the Ten Merciful Kings.
                He caused great confusion in the Palace of Darkness; he abrogated by force the Register of Names, so
                that
                the category of monkeys is now beyond control, and inordinately long life is given to the simian family.
                The wheel of transmigration is stopped, for birth and death are eliminated in each kind of monkey. Your
                poor monk therefore risks offending your Heavenly authority in presenting this memorial. We humbly
                beg you to send forth your divine army and subdue this monster, to the end that life and death may once
                more be regulated and the Underworld rendered perpetually secure. Respectfully we present this
                memorial."</em>
            When the Jade Emperor had finished reading, he again gave a command:
            <em>"Let the Lord of Darkness return to the Underworld. We shall send our generals
                to arrest this culprit."</em> King Qinguang also touched his head to the ground gratefully and
            left.
            The Great Heavenly Deva called together his various immortal subjects, both
            civil and military, and asked, <em>"When was this baneful monkey born, and in which
                generation did he begin his career? How is it that he has become so powerfully
                accomplished in the Way?"</em> Scarcely had he finished speaking when, from the ranks,
            Thousand-Mile Eye and Fair-Wind Ear stepped forward. <em>"This monkey,"</em> they said, <em>"is
                the Heaven-born stone monkey of three hundred years ago. At that time he did not seem
                to amount to much, and we do not know where he acquired the knowledge of selfcultivation these last few
                years and became an immortal. Now he knows how to subdue
                dragons and tame tigers, and thus he is able to annul by force the Register of Death."</em>
            <em>"Which one of you divine generals,"</em> asked the Jade Emperor, <em>"wishes to go
                down there to subdue him?"</em> Scarcely had he finished speaking when the Long-Life
            Spirit of the Planet Venus came forward from the ranks and prostrated himself. <em>"Highest
                and Holiest,"</em> he said, <em>"within the three regions, all creatures endowed with the nine
                apertures can, through exercise, become immortals. It is not surprising that this monkey,
                with a body nurtured by Heaven and Earth, a frame born of the sun and moon, should
                achieve immortality, seeing that his head points to Heaven and his feet walk on Earth,
                and that he feeds on the dew and the mist. Now that he has the power to subdue dragons
                and tame tigers, how is he different from a human being? Your subject therefore makes
                so bold as to ask Your Majesty to remember the compassionate grace of Creation and
                issue a decree of pacification. Let him be summoned to the Upper Region and given
                some kind of official duties. His name will be recorded in the Register and we can
                control him here. If he is receptive to the Heavenly decree, he will be rewarded and
                promoted hereafter; but if he is disobedient to your command, we shall arrest him
                forthwith. Such an action will spare us a military expedition in the first place, and, in the
                second, permit us to receive into our midst another immortal in an orderly manner."</em>
            The Jade Emperor was highly pleased with this statement, and he said, <em>"We
                shall follow the counsel of our minister."</em>
            He then ordered the Star Spirit of Songs and Letters to compose the decree, and
            delegated the Gold Star of Venus to be the viceroy of peace.
            47
            47
            Having received the decree, the Gold Star went out of the South Heaven Gate,
            lowered the direction of his hallowed cloud, and headed straight for the Flower-Fruit
            Mountain and the Water-Curtain Cave. He said to the various little monkeys, <em>"I am the
                Heavenly messenger sent from above. I have with me an imperial decree to invite your
                great king to go to the Upper Region. Report this to him quickly!"</em>
            The monkeys outside the cave passed the word along one by one until it reached
            the depth of the cave. <em>"Great King,"</em> one of the monkeys said, <em>"there's an old man
                outside bearing a document on his back. He says that he is a messenger sent from
                Heaven, and he has an imperial decree of invitation for you."</em> Upon hearing this, the
            Handsome Monkey King was exceedingly pleased. <em>"These last two days,"</em> he said, <em>"I
                was just thinking about taking a little trip to Heaven, and the heavenly messenger has
                already come to invite me!"</em>
            The Monkey King quickly straightened out his attire and went to the door for the
            reception. The Gold Star came into the center of the cave and stood still with his face
            toward the south. <em>"I am the Gold Star of Venus from the West,"</em> he said. <em>"I came down
                to Earth, bearing the imperial decree of pacification from the Jade Emperor, and invite
                you to go to Heaven to receive an immortal appointment."</em> Laughing, Wukong said, <em>"I
                am most grateful for the Old Star's visit."</em>
            He then gave the order:
            <em>"Little ones, prepare a banquet to entertain our guest."</em>
            The Gold Star said, <em>"As a bearer of imperial decree, I cannot remain here long. I
                must ask the Great King to go with me at once. After your glorious promotion, we shall
                have many occasions to converse at our leisure."</em>
            <em>"We are honored by your presence,"</em> said Wukong; <em>"I am sorry that you have to
                leave with empty hands!"</em>
            He then called the four mighty commanders together for this admonition:
            <em>"Be diligent in teaching and drilling the young ones. Let me go up to Heaven to
                take a look and to see whether I can have you all brought up there too to live with me."</em>
            The four mighty commanders indicated their obedience. This Monkey King
            mounted the cloud with the Gold Star and rose up into the sky. Truly
            He ascends the high rank of immortals from the sky;
            His name's enrolled in cloud columns and treasure scrolls.
            We do not know what sort of rank or appointment he received; let's listen to the
            explanation in the next chapter.
