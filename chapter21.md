# The Vihārapālas prepare lodging for the Great Sage <br> Lingji of Sumeru crushes the wind demon.

We shall now tell about those fifty defeated little demons, who rushed into the cave carrying their broken drums and torn banners.

"Great King," they cried, "The Tiger Vanguard was no match for the hairy-faced monk. That monk chased him down the eastern slope until the Vanguard disappeared." When the old monster heard this, he was terribly upset. As he bowed his head in silent deliberation, another little demon who stood guard at the door came to report, "Great King, the Giger Vanguard was beaten to death by the hairyfaced monk and dragged up to our door to provoke battle."

Hearing this, the old monster became even angrier. "This fellow does not know when to stop!" he said. "I have not eaten his master, but he has killed our Vanguard instead. How insolent!" Whereupon he bellowed, "Bring me my armor. I have heard only rumors about this Pilgrim Sun, and I'm going out there to find out what sort of monk he really is. Even if he has nine heads and eight tails, I'm going to take him in here to pay for the life of my Tiger Vanguard!"

The little demons quickly brought out the armor. After having been properly buckled and laced the old monster took a steel trident and leaped out of the cave, leading the reast of the demons, Standing in front of the door, the Great Sage watched the monster emerge with a truly aggressive appearance. Look how he is attrired. You see.

*Gold helmet reflecting the sun;<br>*
*Gold cuirass gleaming with light.<br>*
*A pheasant-tail tassel flies from the helmet;<br>*
*A light yellow silk robe topped by the cuirass,<br>*
*Tied with a dragonlike sash of brilliant hues.<br>*
*His breastplate emits eye-dazzling light.<br>*
*His boots of suede<br>*
*Are dyed by locust flowers.<br>*
*His embroidered kilt<br>*
*Is decked with willow leaves.<br>*
*Holding a sharp trident in his hands,<br>*
*He seems almost the Erlang Boy of old<br>*

When he had come out, the old monster shouted, "Who is Pilgrim Sum?" With one foot on the carcass of the Tiger Monster and the compliant iron rod in his hands, Pilgrim replied: "Your Grandpa Sun is here! Send my master out!", The old monster took a careful look and saw the diminutive figure of Pilgrim less than four feet, in fact and his sallow cheeks. He said with a laugh: "Too bad! too bad! I thought you were some kind of invicible here. But you are only a sickly gost, with nothing more than your skeleton left!"

"Child," said Pilgrim laughing, "how you lack perception! Your grandpa may be somewhat samll in size, but if you have to courage to hit me on the head with the handle of your trident, I'll grow six feet at once."

"Harden your head," said the monster, "and have a taste of my handle!" Our Great Sage was not in the least frightened. When the monster struck him once, he stretched his waist and at once grew more than six feet, attaining the height of ten feet altogether. The monster was so alarmed that he tried to use his trident to hold him down, shouting, "Pilgrim Sun, how dare you stand at my door, displaying this paltry magic of body protection! Stop using tricks! Come up here and let's measure our real abilities!"

"My dear son," said Pilgrim with laughter, "the proverb says:"

"Mercy should be shown before the hand is raised!" Your grandpa is pretty heavy-handed, and he fears that you won't be able to bear even one stroke of this rob!" Refusing to listen to any such discussion, the monster turned his trident around and stabbed at Pilgrim's chest. The Great Sage, of course, was not at all perturbed, for as the saying goes, the expert is never exercised. He raised his rob and, using the movement of the "black dragon sweeping the ground" to parry the trident, struck at the monster's head, The two of them thus began a fierce battle before that Yellow Wind Cave:
```
The Monster King became enraged;
The Great Sage released his might.
The Monster King became enraged,
Wishing to seize Pilgrim to pay for his Vanguard.
The Great Sage released his might
To capture this spirit and to save the priest.
The trident arrived, blocked by the rod;
The rod went forth, met by the trident.
This one, a mountain-ruling captain of his hosts.
That one, the Handsome Monkey King who defends the Law.
At first they fought on the dusty earth;
Then each arose midway to the sky.
The fine steel trident;
Pointed, sharp, and brilliant.
The compliant rod:
Body black and yellow hoops.
Stabbed by them, your soul goes back to darkness!
Struck by them, you‟ll face King Yama!
You must rely on quick arms and keen sight.
You must have a tough frame and great strength.
The two fought without regard for life or death;
We know not who will be safe or who will be hurt.
```
The old monster and the Great Sage fought for thirty rounds, but neither could gain the upper hand. Pressing for a quick victory, Pilgrim decided to use the trick of "the body beyond the body."

He tore from himself a handful of hairs that he chewed to pieces in his mouth. Spitting them out, he cried, "Change!"

They changed at once into more than a hundred Pilgrims: all having the same appearnce and all holding an iron rod, they surrounded the monster in midair.

Somewhat alarmed, the monster also resorted to his speacial talent. He turned to face the ground to the southwest and opened his mouth thre times to blow out some air. Suddenly a mighty yellow wind arose in the sky. Dear wind! It was indeed powerful.
```
Cold and whistling, it changed Heaven and Earth,
As yellow sand whirled without form or shape.
It cut through woods and hills to break pines and plums;
It tossed up dirt and dust, cracking crags and cliffs.
Waves churned in Yellow River to cloud its floor;
Tide and current swelled up at River Xiang.
The Polestar Palace in the blue sky shook;
The Hall of Darkness was almost blown down;
The Five Hundred Arhats all yelled and screamed;
The Eight Guards of Akṣobhya all cried and shrieked.
Mañjuśrī‟s green-haired lion ran away;
Viśvabhadra lost his white elephant.
Snake and turtle of Zhenwu left their fold;
Aflutter were the saddle-flaps of Zitong‟s mule.
Traveling merchants sent their cries to Heaven,
And boatmen bowed to make their many vows—
Their mistlike lives awash in rolling waves;
Their names, their fortunes, adrift in the tide!
Caves on genie mountains were black as pitch;
The isle of Penglai was gloomy and dark.
Laozi could not tend his elixir oven;
Age Star folded his fan of grapevine leaves.
As Queen Mother went to the Peaches Feast,
The wind blew her skirt and pins awry.
Erlang lost his way to the Guanzhou town;
Naṭa found it hard to pull out his sword.
Li Jing missed the pagoda in his hand;
Lu Ban dropped his golden-headed drill.
While three stories of Thunderclap fell down,
The stone bridge at Zhaozhou broke in twain.
The orb of the red sun had little light;
The stars of all Heaven grew obscure and faint.
Birds of south mountains flew to northern hills;
Water of east lakes spilled over to the west.
Fowls with mates broke up, they ceased their calls;
Mothers and sons parted, their cries turned mute.
Dragon Kings sought yakṣas all over the sea;
Thunder gods hunted lightnings every where.
Ten Kings of Yama tried to find their judge;
In Hell, Bull- Head ran after Horse- Face.
This wind blew down the Potalaka Mount
And whipped up one scroll of Guanyin‟s verse.
White lotus-blooms, cut down, flew beside the sea;
Twelve halls of the Bodhisattva were blown down.
From Pan Gu till this time since wind was known,
There never was wind with such ferocity.
Hu-la-la!
The universe did almost split apart!
The whole world was one mighty trembling mass!
```
This violent wind called up by the monster blew away all those little Pilgrims formed by the Great Sage's hairs and send them reeling through the air like so many spining wheels. unable even to wield their rods, how could they possibly hope to draw near to fight? Pilgrim was so alarmed that he shooke his body and retrived his hairs. He then lifted the iron rod and tried to attack the monster all by himself, only to be met by a mouthful of yellow wind right on his face. Those two fiery eyes with diamond pupils of his were so blasted that they shut tightly and could not be opened. No longer able to use his rod, he fled in defeat while the monster retrived the wind, which we shall mention no further.

We tell you now about Zhu Eight Rules, who, when he saw the violent yellow windstom arriving and the whole of Heaven and Eath growing dim, led the horse and took the luggage to the fold of the mountain. There he crouched on the ground and refused to open his eyes or raise his head, his mouth incessantly calling on the name of Buddha and making vows. As he was wondering how Pilgrim was faring in his battle and where his master was dead or alive, the wind stopped and the sky brightened again, He looked up and peered toward the entrance of the cave, but he could neither see any movement of weapons nor hear the sound of gongs and drums.
