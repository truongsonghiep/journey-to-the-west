# The Vihārapālas prepare lodging for the Great Sage <br> Lingji of Sumeru crushes the wind demon.

We shall now tell about those fifty defeated little demons, who rushed into the cave carrying their broken drums and torn banners.

"Great King," they cried, "The Tiger Vanguard was no match for the hairy-faced monk. That monk chased him down the eastern slope until the Vanguard disappeared." When the old monster heard this, he was terribly upset. As he bowed his head in silent deliberation, another little demon who stood guard at the door came to report, "Great King, the Giger Vanguard was beaten to death by the hairyfaced monk and dragged up to our door to provoke battle."

Hearing this, the old monster became even angrier. "This fellow does not know when to stop!" he said. "I have not eaten his master, but he has killed our Vanguard instead. How insolent!" Whereupon he bellowed, "Bring me my armor. I have heard only rumors about this Pilgrim Sun, and I'm going out there to find out what sort of monk he really is. Even if he has nine heads and eight tails, I'm going to take him in here to pay for the life of my Tiger Vanguard!"

The little demons quickly brought out the armor. After having been properly buckled and laced the old monster took a steel trident and leaped out of the cave, leading the reast of the demons, Standing in front of the door, the Great Sage watched the monster emerge with a truly aggressive appearance. Look how he is attrired. You see.
`
Gold helmet reflecting the sun;
Gold cuirass gleaming with light.
A pheasant-tail tassel flies from the helmet;
A light yellow silk robe topped by the cuirass,
Tied with a dragonlike sash of brilliant hues.
His breastplate emits eye-dazzling light.
His boots of suede
Are dyed by locust flowers.
His embroidered kilt
Is decked with willow leaves.
Holding a sharp trident in his hands,
He seems almost the Erlang Boy of old
`
When he had come out, the old monster shouted, "Who is Pilgrim Sum?" With one foot on the carcass of the Tiger Monster and the compliant iron rod in his hands, Pilgrim replied: "Your Grandpa Sun is here! Send my master out!", The old monster took a careful look and saw the diminutive figure of Pilgrim less than four feet, in fact and his sallow cheeks. He said with a laugh: "Too bad! too bad! I thought you were some kind of invicible here. But you are only a sickly gost, with nothing more than your skeleton left!"
