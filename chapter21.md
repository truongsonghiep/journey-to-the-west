# The Vihārapālas prepare lodging for the Great Sage <br> Lingji of Sumeru crushes the wind demon.

We shall now tell about those fifty defeated little demons, who rushed into the cave carrying their broken drums and torn banners.

"Great King," they cried, "The Tiger Vanguard was no match for the hairy-faced monk. That monk chased him down the eastern slope until the Vanguard disappeared." When the old monster heard this, he was terribly upset. As he bowed his head in silent deliberation, another little demon who stood guard at the door came to report, "Great King, the Giger Vanguard was beaten to death by the hairyfaced monk and dragged up to our door to provoke battle."

Hearing this, the old monster became even angrier. "This fellow does not know when to stop!" he said. "I have not eaten his master, but he has killed our Vanguard instead. How insolent!" Whereupon he bellowed, "Bring me my armor. I have heard only rumors about this Pilgrim Sun, and I'm going out there to find out what sort of monk he really is. Even if he has nine heads and eight tails, I'm going to take him in here to pay for the life of my Tiger Vanguard!"

The little demons quickly brought out the armor. After having been properly buckled and laced the old monster took a steel trident and leaped out of the cave, leading the reast of the demons, Standing in front of the door, the Great Sage watched the monster emerge with a truly aggressive appearance. Look how he is attrired. You see.

*Gold helmet reflecting the sun;<br>*
*Gold cuirass gleaming with light.<br>*
*A pheasant-tail tassel flies from the helmet;<br>*
*A light yellow silk robe topped by the cuirass,<br>*
*Tied with a dragonlike sash of brilliant hues.<br>*
*His breastplate emits eye-dazzling light.<br>*
*His boots of suede<br>*
*Are dyed by locust flowers.<br>*
*His embroidered kilt<br>*
*Is decked with willow leaves.<br>*
*Holding a sharp trident in his hands,<br>*
*He seems almost the Erlang Boy of old<br>*

When he had come out, the old monster shouted, "Who is Pilgrim Sum?" With one foot on the carcass of the Tiger Monster and the compliant iron rod in his hands, Pilgrim replied: "Your Grandpa Sun is here! Send my master out!", The old monster took a careful look and saw the diminutive figure of Pilgrim less than four feet, in fact and his sallow cheeks. He said with a laugh: "Too bad! too bad! I thought you were some kind of invicible here. But you are only a sickly gost, with nothing more than your skeleton left!"

"Child," said Pilgrim laughing, "how you lack perception! Your grandpa may be somewhat samll in size, but if you have to courage to hit me on the head with the handle of your trident, I'll grow six feet at once."

"Harden your head," said the monster, "and have a taste of my handle!" Our Great Sage was not in the least frightened. When the monster struck him once, he stretched his waist and at once grew more than six feet, attaining the height of ten feet altogether. The monster was so alarmed that he tried to use his trident to hold him down, shouting, "Pilgrim Sun, how dare you stand at my door, displaying this paltry magic of body protection! Stop using tricks! Come up here and let's measure our real abilities!"

"My dear son," said Pilgrim with laughter, "the proverb says:"

"Mercy should be shown before the hand is raised!" Your grandpa is pretty heavy-handed, and he fears that you won't be able to bear even one stroke of this rob!" Refusing to listen to any such discussion, the monster turned his trident around and stabbed at Pilgrim's chest. The Great Sage, of course, was not at all perturbed, for as the saying goes, the expert is never exercised. He raised his rob and, using the movement of the "black dragon sweeping the ground" to parry the trident, struck at the monster's head, The two of them thus began a fierce battle before that Yellow Wind Cave:
```
The Monster King became enraged;
The Great Sage released his might.
The Monster King became enraged,
Wishing to seize Pilgrim to pay for his Vanguard.
The Great Sage released his might
To capture this spirit and to save the priest.
The trident arrived, blocked by the rod;
The rod went forth, met by the trident.
This one, a mountain-ruling captain of his hosts.
That one, the Handsome Monkey King who defends the Law.
At first they fought on the dusty earth;
Then each arose midway to the sky.
The fine steel trident;
Pointed, sharp, and brilliant.
The compliant rod:
Body black and yellow hoops.
Stabbed by them, your soul goes back to darkness!
Struck by them, you‟ll face King Yama!
You must rely on quick arms and keen sight.
You must have a tough frame and great strength.
The two fought without regard for life or death;
We know not who will be safe or who will be hurt.
```
The old monster and the Great Sage fought for thirty rounds, but neither could gain the upper hand. Pressing for a quick victory, Pilgrim decided to use the trick of "the body beyond the body."

He tore from himself a handful of hairs that he chewed to pieces in his mouth. Spitting them out, he cried, "Change!"

They changed at once into more than a hundred Pilgrims: all having the same appearnce and all holding an iron rod, they surrounded the monster in midair.
