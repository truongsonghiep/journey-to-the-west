FORTY-FIVE
At the Three Pure Ones Abbey the Great Sage leaves his name
At the Cart Slow Kingdom the Monkey King shows his power
We now tell you about the Great Sage Sun, who used his left hand to give Sha
Monk a pinch, and his right to give Zhu Eight Rules a pinch. Immediately
understanding what he meant, the two of them fell silent and sat with lowered faces on
their high seats. They allowed those Daoists to examine them back and front with
uplifted lamps and torches, but the three of them seemed no more than idols made of
clay and adorned with gold.
“There are no thieves around,” said the Tiger-Strength Immortal, “but then, why
are all the offerings eaten?”
“It definitely looks as if humans have eaten them,” said the Deer-Strength
Immortal. “Look how the fruits are skinned and their stones spat out. Why is it that we
don‟t see any human form?”
“Don‟t be too suspicious, Elder Brothers,” said the Goat-Strength Immortal. “I
think that our piety and sincerity of reciting scriptures and saying prayers here night and
day, all in the name of the court, must have aroused the Celestial Worthies. The
Venerable Fathers of the Three Pure Ones, I suppose, must have descended to earth and
consumed these offerings. Why don‟t we take advantage of the fact that their holy train
and crane carriages are still here and make supplication to the Celestial Worthies? We
should beg for some golden elixir and holy water with which we may present His
Majesty. Wouldn‟t his long life and perpetual youth be in fact our merit?”
“You are right,” said the Tiger-Strength Immortal. “Disciples, start the music
and recite the scriptures. Bring us our ritual robes. Let me tread the stars to make our
supplication.”
Those little Daoists all obeyed and lined themselves up on both sides. At the
sound of the gong, they all recited in unison the scroll of True Scriptures of the Yellow
Court. After having put on his ritual robe, the Tiger-Strength Immortal held high his
jade tablet and began to kick up the dust with dancing. Intermittently he would fall to
the ground and prostrate himself. Then he intoned this petition:
“In fear and dread,
We bow most humbly.
To stir up our faith
We seek Purity.
Vile priests we quell
To honor the Way.
This hall we build
The king to obey.
Dragon flags we raise,
And off‟rings display;
Torches by night,
Incense by day.
One thought sincere
Doth Heaven sway.
585
585
Chariots divine
Now come to stay.
Grant unto us some elixir and holy water,
Which we may give to His Majesty
That he may gain longevity.”
When Eight Rules heard these words, he was filled with apprehension. “This is
our fault! We‟ve eaten the goods and should be on our way. Now, how shall we answer
such supplication?” Pilgrim gave him another pinch before suddenly opening his mouth
and speaking out loud, “You immortals of a younger generation, please stop your
recitation. We have just returned from the Festival of Immortal Peaches, and we have
not brought along any golden elixir or holy water. In another day we shall come to
bestow them on you.” When those Daoists, old and young, heard that the image had
actually spoken, every one of them trembled violently till even their garments quaked.
“O Fathers!” they cried, “the living Celestial Worthies have descended to earth. We
must not let them go. We must insist on their giving us some sort of magic formula for
eternal youth.”
Then the Deer-Strength Immortal went forward also to prostrate himself and
intone this supplication:
“Our heads to the dust,
We pray earnestly.
Your subjects submit
To the Pure Ones Three.
Since we came here,
The Way was set free.
The king is pleased
To seek longevity.
This Heavenly Mass
Chants scriptures nightly.
We thank the Celestial Worthies
For revealing their presence holy.
O hear our prayers!
We seek your glory!
Do leave some holy water behind,
That your disciples long life may find!”
Sha Monk gave Pilgrim a pinch and whispered fiercely, “Elder Brother! They
are at it again! Just listen to the prayer!”
“All right,” said Pilgrim, “let‟s give them something.”
“Where could we find it?” muttered Eight Rules. “Just watch me,” said Pilgrim,
“and when you see that I have it, you‟ll have it too!”
After those Daoists had finished their music and their prayers, Pilgrim again
spoke out loud, “You immortals of a younger generation, there‟s no need for your
bowing and praying any longer. I am rather reluctant to leave you some holy water, but
I fear then that our posterity will die out. If I gave you some, however, it would seem to
be too easy a boon.” When those Daoists heard these words, they all prostrated
themselves and kowtowed. “We beseech the Celestial Worthies to have regard for the
reverence of your disciples,” they cried, “and we beg you to leave us some. We shall
586
586
proclaim far and near the Way and Virtue. We shall memorialize to the king to give
added honors to the Gate of Mystery.”
“In that case,” said Pilgrim, “bring us some vessels.”
The Daoists all touched their heads to the ground to give thanks. Being the
greediest, the Tiger-Strength Immortal hauled in a huge cistern and placed it in the hall.
The Deer-Strength Immortal fetched an earthenware garden vase and put it on top of the
offering table. The Goat-Strength Immortal pulled out the flowers from a flowerpot and
placed it in the middle of the other two vessels. Then Pilgrim said to them, “Now leave
the hall and close the shutters so that the Heavenly mysteries will not be seen by profane
eyes. We shall leave you some holy water.”
The Daoists retreated from the hall and closed the doors, after which they all
prostrated themselves before the vermilion steps.
Pilgrim stood up at once and, lifting up his tiger-skin kilt, filled the flowerpot
with his stinking urine. Delighted by what he saw, Zhu Eight Rules said, “Elder
Brother, you and I have been brothers these few years but we have never had fun like
this before. Since I gorged myself just now, I have been feeling the urge to do this.”
Lifting up his clothes, our Idiot let loose such a torrent that it sounded as if the Lüliang
Cascade had crashed onto some wooden boards! He pissed till he filled the whole
garden vase. Sha Monk, too, left behind half a cistern. They then straightened their
clothes and resumed their seats solemnly before they called out, “Little ones, receive
your holy water.” Pushing open the shutters, those Daoists kowtowed repeatedly to give
thanks. They carried the cistern out first, and then they poured the contents of the vase
and the pot into the bigger vessel, mixing the liquids together. “Disciples,” said the
Tiger-Strength Immortal, “bring me a cup so that I can have a taste.”
A young Daoist immediately fetched a teacup and handed it to the old Daoist.
After bailing out a cup of it and gulping down a huge mouthful, the old Daoist kept
wiping his mouth and puckering his lips. “Elder Brother,” said the Deer-Strength
Immortal, “is it good?”
“Not very good,” said the old Daoist, his lips still pouted, “the flavor is quite
potent!”
“Let me try it also,” said the Goat-Strength Immortal, and he, too, downed a
mouthful. Immediately he said, “It smells somewhat like hog urine!” Sitting high above
them and hearing this remark, Pilgrim knew that he could no longer fool them. He
thought to himself, “I might as well display my abilities and leave them our names too.”
He cried out in a loud voice,
“O Daoists, Daoists,
You are so silly!
Which Three Pure Ones
Would be so worldly?
Let our true names
Be told most clearly.
Monks of the Great Tang
Go West by decree.
We come to your place
This fine night carefree.
Your offerings eaten,
587
587
We sit and play.
Your bows and greetings
How could we repay?
That was no holy water you drank.
Twas only the urine we pissed that stank!”
The moment the Daoists heard this, they barred the door. Picking up pitchforks,
rakes, brooms, tiles, rocks, and whatever else they could put their hands on, they sent
these hurtling inside the main hall to attack the impostors. Dear Pilgrim! Using his left
hand to catch hold of Sha Monk and his right to take hold of Eight Rules, he crashed out
of the door and mounted the cloudy luminosity to go straight back to the Wisdom Depth
Monastery. When they arrived at the abbot‟s residence, they dared not disturb their
master; each went to bed quietly and slept until the third quarter of the fifth watch. At
that time, of course, the king began to hold his morning court, where two rows of civil
and military officials—some four hundred of them—stood at attention. You see
Bright lamps and torches midst purple gauze;
Fragrant clouds rising from treasure tripods.
As soon as Tripitaka Tang woke up, he said, “Disciples, help me to go and have
our travel rescript certified.” Rising quickly, Pilgrim, Sha Monk, and Eight Rules
slipped on their clothes and stood to one side to wait on their master. They said, “Let it
be known to our master that this king truly believes only the Daoists and is eager to
exalt the Way and to exterminate the Buddhists. We fear that any illspoken word may
cause him to refuse to certify our rescript. Let us therefore accompany Master to enter
the court.”
Highly pleased, the Tang Monk draped the brocaded cassock on himself while
Pilgrim took out the travel rescript; Wujing was told to hold the alms bowl and Wuneng
to take up the priestly staff. The luggage and the horse were placed in the care of the
monks of the Wisdom Depth Monastery. They went before the Five-Phoenix Tower and
saluted the Custodian of the Yellow Gate. Having identified themselves, they declared
that they were scripture pilgrims from the Great Tang in the Land of the East, who
wished to have their travel rescript certified and would therefore like the custodian to
announce their arrival. The official of the gate went at once into court and prostrated
himself before the golden steps to memorialize to the king, saying, “There are four
Buddhist monks outside who claim that they are scripture pilgrims from the Great Tang
in the Land of the East. They wish to have their travel rescript certified, and they now
await Your Majesty‟s decree before the Five-Phoenix Tower.” When the king heard
this, he said, “These monks have nowhere to court death and, of all places, they have to
do it here! Why didn‟t our constables arrest them at once and bring them here?”
A Grand Preceptor before the throne stepped forward and said, “The Great Tang
in the Land of the East is located in the South Jambūdvīpa Continent; it‟s the great
nation of China, some ten thousand miles from here. As the way is infested with
monsters and fiends, these monks must have considerable magic powers or they would
not dare undertake this westward journey. I implore Your Majesty to invite them in and
certify their rescript so that they may proceed, for the sake of the fact that they are the
distant monks from China and for the sake of not destroying any goodly affinity.”
The king gave his consent and summoned the Tang Monk and his followers
before the Hall of Golden Chimes. After master and disciples arrived before the steps,
they presented the rescript to the king. The king opened the document and was about to
588
588
read it, when the Custodian of the Yellow Gate appeared to announce, “The three
Preceptors of State have arrived.”
The king was so flustered that he put away the rescript hurriedly and left the
dragon seat. After having ordered his attendants to set out some embroidered cushions,
he bent his body to receive his visitors. When Tripitaka and his followers turned around
to look, they saw those three great immortals swagger in, followed by a young acolyte
with two tousled pigtails. Not daring even to lift their eyes, the two rows of officials all
bowed deeply as they walked by. After they ascended the Hall of Golden Chimes, they
did not even bother to salute the king.
“State Preceptors,” said the king, “we have not invited you. How is it that you
are pleased to visit us today?”
“We have something to tell you,” said one of the old Daoists, “and that‟s why
we‟re here. Those four monks down there, where do they come from?”
The king said, “They were sent by the Great Tang in the Land of the East to
fetch scriptures, and they presented themselves here to have their travel rescript
certified.”
Clapping their hands together, the three Daoists burst out laughing and said,
“We thought they had fled. So they are still here!” Somewhat startled, the king said,
“What do you mean, Preceptors? When we first heard of their arrival, we wanted to
arrest them and send them to serve you, had not our Grand Preceptor on duty intervened
and presented a most reasonable memorial.
Since we had regard for the fact that they had traveled a great distance, and since
we did not wish to destroy our goodly affinity with China, we summoned them in here
to verify their rescript. We did not expect you to raise any question about them. Could it
be that they have offended you in some way?”
“Your Majesty wouldn‟t know about this,” said one of the Daoists, chuckling.
“Hardly had they arrived yesterday when they slew two of our disciples outside the
eastern gate. The five hundred Buddhist prisoners were all released and the cart was
smashed to pieces.
As if that weren‟t enough, they sneaked into our temple last night, vandalized
the holy images of the Three Pure Ones, and devoured all the imperial offerings. We
were fooled by them at first, thinking that the Celestial Worthies had descended to
Earth. We therefore even asked them to give us some golden elixir and holy water with
which we might present Your Majesty, so that you would be blessed with eternal youth.
We hardly expected that they would trick us by leaving us their urine. We found out all
right, after each of us had tasted a mouthful! Just when we were about to seize them,
they managed to escape. We didn‟t think that they would dare remain here today. As the
proverb says, „The road for fated enemies is narrow indeed‟!” When the king heard this,
he became so irate that he would have had the four priests executed at once. Pressing his
palms together, the Great Sage Sun cried out in a loud voice, saying, “Your Majesty, let
your thunderlike wrath subside for the moment and permit this monk to present his
memorial.”
“You offended the State Preceptors!” said the king. “Do you dare imply that
their words might be erroneous?” Pilgrim said, “He claimed that yesterday we
slaughtered two of his disciples outside the city. But who could be a witness? Even if
we were to confess to this crime, and that would be a gross injustice, only two of us
589
589
need be asked to pay with our lives, and two of us should be released so that we might
proceed to acquire the scriptures. He claimed further that we wrecked their cart and
released their Buddhist prisoners. Again, there is no witness, and moreover, this is
hardly a mortal offense and only one of us should be punished for this if it were true.
Finally, he charged us with vandalizing the images of the Three Pure Ones and causing
disturbance in their temple. This is clearly a trap they set for us.”
“How could you say that it‟s a trap?” asked the king.
“We monks are from the Land of the East,” said Pilgrim, “and we‟ve just arrived
in this region. We can‟t even tell one street from another. How could we know about the
affairs of their temple, and at night no less? If we could leave them our urine, they
should have been able to arrest us right then and there. Why did they wait until this
morning to accuse us? In this whole wide world, there are countless people who use
false identities. How could they know for certain that we are guilty? I beg Your Majesty
to withhold your anger and make a thorough investigation.”
The king, after all, had always been rather muddle-headed. When he heard this
lengthy speech by Pilgrim, he became more confused than ever.
Just then, the Custodian of the Yellow Gate again came to make this
announcement:
“Your Majesty, there are outside the gate many village elders who await your
summons.”
“For what reason?” asked the king. He ordered them brought in, and thirty or
forty village elders came before the hall. “Your Majesty,” they said as they kowtowed,
“there has been no rain this year for the entire spring, and we fear that there will be a
famine if it remains dry like this through summer. We have come especially to request
that one of the Holy Fathers, the Preceptors of State, pray for sweet rain that will succor
the entire population.”
The king said, “Let the village elders withdraw. Rain will be forthcoming.”
The village elders gave thanks and left.
Then the king said, “You, priests of the Tang court, why do you think that we
honor the Dao and seek to destroy Buddhism? It was because in years past, the monks
of this dynasty attempted to pray for rain, and they could not produce even a single
drop. It was our good fortune that these Preceptors of State descended from Heaven and
saved us from our bitter affliction. Now all of you have offended the Preceptors of State
no sooner than you arrived from a great distance, and you should be condemned. We
shall pardon you for the moment, however, and ask whether you dare to have a
rainmaking competition with our Preceptors. If your prayers could bring us the rain to
assuage the needs of the people, we would pardon you, certify your rescript, and permit
you to journey to the West. If you fail in your competition and no rain comes, all of you
will be taken to the block and beheaded publicly.” With a laugh, Pilgrim said, “This
little priest has some knowledge of prayers, too!” When the king heard this, he at once
asked for an altar to be built. Meanwhile, he also gave the command that his carriage be
brought out. “We want personally to ascend the Five-Phoenix Tower to watch,” he said.
Many officials followed the carriage up the tower and the king took his seat. Tripitaka
Tang, followed by Pilgrim, Sha Monk, and Eight Rules, stood at attention down below,
while the three Daoists also accompanied the king and took their seats on the tower. In a
590
590
little while, an official came riding with the report, “The altar is ready. Let one of the
Father Preceptors of State ascend it.”
Bowing with his hands folded before him, the Tiger-Strength Immortal took
leave of the king and walked down the tower. “Sir,” said Pilgrim, barring his way,
“where are you going?”
“To ascend the altar and pray for rain,” said the Great Immortal. “You do have a
sense of self-importance,” said Pilgrim, “absolutely unwilling to defer to us monks who
have come from a great distance. All right! As the proverb says, „Even a strong dragon
is no match for a local worm!‟ But if the master insists on proceeding first, then he must
make a statement first before the king.”
“What statement?” asked the Great Immortal. Pilgrim said, “Both you and I are
supposed to ascend the altar to pray for rain. When it comes, how could anyone tell
whether it‟s your rain or mine? Who could tell whose merit it is?” When the king above
them heard this, he was secretly pleased and said, “The words of this little priest are
quite gutsy!” When Sha Monk heard this, he said to himself, smiling, “You don‟t know
that his stomach‟s full of gutsiness! He hasn‟t shown much of it yet!”
The Great Immortal said, “There‟s no need for me to make any statement. His
Majesty is quite familiar with what I am about to do.”
“He may know it,” said Pilgrim, “but I am a monk who came from a distant
region. I have never met you and I‟m not familiar with what you are about to do. I don‟t
want us to end up accusing each other later, for that wouldn‟t be good business. We
must settle this first before we act.”
“All right,” said the Great Immortal, “when I ascend the altar, I shall use my
ritual tablet as a sign. When I bang it loudly on the table once, wind will come; the
second time, clouds will gather; the third time, there will be lightning and thunder; the
fourth time, rain will come; and finally the fifth time, rain will stop and clouds will
disperse.”
“Marvelous!” said Pilgrim, laughing. “I have never seen this before! Please go!
Please go!” With great strides, the Great Immortal walked forward, followed by
Tripitaka and the rest. As they approached the altar, they saw that it was a platform
about thirty feet tall. On all sides were flown banners with the names of the TwentyEight Constellations written on them. There was a table on top of the altar, and on the
table was set an urn filled with burning incense. On both sides of the urn were two
candle stands with huge, brightly lit candles. Leaning against the urn was a tablet made
of gold, carved with the names of the thunder deities. Beneath the table were five huge
cisterns full of clear water and afloat with willow branches. To the branches was
attached a thin sheet of iron inscribed with the charms used to summon the agents of the
Thunder Bureau. Five huge pillars were also set up around the table, and written on
these pillars were the names of the barbarian thunder lords of Five Quarters. There were
two Daoists standing on both sides of each pillar; each of the Daoists held an iron
bludgeon used for pounding on the pillar. There were also many Daoists drawing up
documents behind the altar. Before them there were set up a brazier for burning papers
and several statues, all representing the messengers of charms, the local spirits, and
patron deities.
The Great Immortal, without affecting the slightest degree of modesty, walked
straight up to the altar and stood still. A young Daoist presented him with several
charms written on yellow papers and a treasure sword. Holding the sword, the Great
591
591
Immortal recited a spell and then burnt a charm on the flame of a candle. Down below
several Daoists picked up a document and a statue holding a charm and had these
burned also. With a bang the old Daoist high above brought down his ritual tablet on the
table and at once a breeze could be felt in the air. “O dear! O dear!” muttered Eight
Rules. “This Daoist is certainly quite capable! He bangs his tablet once and indeed the
wind‟s rising.”
“Be quiet, Brother,” said Pilgrim. “Don‟t speak to me anymore. Just stand guard
over Master here and let me do my business.”
Dear Great Sage! He pulled off a piece of hair and blew on it his immortal
breath, saying, “Change!” It changed at once into a spurious Pilgrim, standing next to
the Tang Monk. His true body rose with his primal spirit into midair, where he shouted,
“Who is in charge of the wind here?”
He so startled the Old Woman of the Wind that she hugged her bag while the
Second Boy of the Wind pulled tight the rope at the mouth of the bag. They stepped
forward to salute Pilgrim, who said, “I am accompanying the holy monk of the Tang
court to go to acquire scriptures in the Western Heaven. We happen to pass through the
Cart Slow Kingdom and are now waging a rainmaking contest with that deviant Daoist.
How could you not help old Monkey and assist that Daoist instead? I‟ll pardon you this
time, but you‟d better call in the wind. If there‟s just the tiniest breeze to make the
whiskers of the Daoist flutter, each of you will receive twenty strokes of the iron rod!”
“We dare not! We dare not!” said the Old Woman of the Wind, and so, there
was no sign of any wind. Unable to contain himself, Eight Rules began to holler, “You
Sir, please step down! You‟ve banged aloud the tablet. How is it that there‟s no wind?
You come down, and let us go up there.”
Holding high his tablet, the Daoist burned another charm before bringing down
his tablet once more. Immediately, clouds and fog began to form in midair, but the
Great Sage Sun shouted again, “Who is spreading the clouds?”
He so startled the Cloud-Pushing Boy and the Fog-Spreading Lad that they
hurriedly came forward to salute him. After Pilgrim had given his explanation as before,
the Cloud Boy and the Mist Lad removed the clouds, so that
The sun came out and shone most brilliantly;
The sky was cloudless for ten thousand miles.
Laughing, Eight Rules said, “This master may deceive the king and befool his
subjects. But he hasn‟t any real abilities! Why, the tablet has sounded twice! Why is it
that we don‟t see any clouds forming?”
Becoming rather agitated, the Daoist loosened his hair, picked up his sword, and
recited another spell as he burned a charm. Once more he brought down his tablet with a
bang, and immediately the Heavenly Lord Deng arrived from the South Heaven Gate,
trailed by the Squire of Thunder and the Mother of Lightning. When they saw Pilgrim in
midair, they saluted him, and he gave his explanation as before. “What powerful
summons,” he said “brought you all here so quickly?”
The Heavenly Lord said, “The proper magic of Five Thunder exercised by that
Daoist was not faked.
He issued the summons and burned the document, which alerted the Jade
Emperor.
592
592
The Jade Emperor sent his decree to the residence of the Primordial Celestial
Worthy of All-Pervading Thunderclap in the Ninefold Heaven. We in turn received his
command to come here and assist with the rainmaking by providing thunder and
lightning.”
“In that case,” said Pilgrim, “just wait a moment. You can help old Monkey
instead.”
There was, therefore, neither the sound of thunder nor the flash of lightning.
In sheer desperation now, that Daoist added more incense, burned his charms,
recited more spells, and struck his tablet more loudly than ever. In midair, the Dragon
Kings of Four Oceans all arrived together, only to be met by Pilgrim, who shouted,
“Aoguang, where do you think you‟re going?”
Aoguang, Aoshun, Aoqin, and Aorun all went forward to salute him, and
Pilgrim gave his explanation as before. He thanked the Dragon Kings moreover, saying,
“I needed your help in times past, but we have not yet reached our goal.
Today, I must rely on your assistance once more to help me achieve this merit
right now. That Daoist has struck his tablet four times, and it‟s now old Monkey‟s turn
to do business. But I don‟t know how to burn charms, issue summons, or strike any
tablet. So all of you must play along with me.”
The Heavenly Lord Deng said, “If the Great Sage gives us the order, who would
dare disobey? You must, however, give us a sign, so that we may follow your
instructions in an orderly manner. Otherwise, thunder and rain may be all mixed up, and
that will not be to the credit of the Great Sage.” Pilgrim said, “I‟ll use my rod as the
sign.”
“O Dear Father!” cried the Squire of Thunder, horrified. “How could we take the
rod?”
“I‟m not going to strike you,” said Pilgrim. “All I want from you is to watch the
rod. If I point it upwards once, you‟ll make the wind blow.”
“We‟ll make the wind blow!” snapped the Old Woman of the Wind and the
Second Boy of the Wind in unison.
“When the rod points upward a second time, you‟ll spread the clouds.”
“We‟ll spread the clouds! We‟ll spread the clouds!” cried the Cloud-Pushing
Boy and the Mist-Spreading Lad.
“When I point the rod upwards for the third time, I want thunder and lightning.”
“We‟ll provide the service! We‟ll provide the service!” said the Squire of
Thunder and the Mother of Lightning.
“When I point the rod upwards the fourth time, I want rain.”
“We obey! We obey!” said the Dragon Kings.
“And when I point the rod upwards the fifth time, I want sunshine and fair
weather. Don‟t make any mistake!”
After he had given all these instructions, Pilgrim dropped down from the clouds
and retrieved his hair back to his body. Being of fleshly eyes and mortal stock, how
could those people know the difference? Pilgrim then cried out with a loud voice, “Sir,
593
593
please stop! You have struck aloud the tablet four times, but there‟s not the slightest
sign of wind, cloud, thunder, or rain. You should let me take over.”
The Daoist had no choice but to leave his place and come down the altar for
Pilgrim to take his turn. Pouting, he went back to the tower to see the throne. “Let me
follow him,” said Pilgrim, “and see what he has to say.”
He arrived and heard the king asking the Daoist, “We have been listening here
most eagerly for the sounds of your tablet. Four times it struck and there was neither
wind nor rain. Why is that?”
The Daoist said, “Today the dragon deities are not home.” Pilgrim shouted with
a loud voice, “Your Majesty, the dragon deities are home all right, but the magic of your
National Preceptor is not efficacious enough to bring them here. Allow us priests to
summon them here for you to see.”
“Ascend the altar at once,” said the king, “and we shall wait for the rain here.”
Having received this decree, Pilgrim dashed back to the altar and tugged at the
Tang Monk, saying, “Master, please go up to the altar.”
“Disciple,” said the Tang Monk, “I don‟t know how to pray for rain.”
“He‟s trying to set you up,” said Eight Rules, laughing. “If there‟s no rain,
they‟ll put you on the pyre and finish you off with a fire.” Pilgrim said, “Though you
may not know how to pray for rain, you know how to recite scriptures. Let me help
you.”
The elder indeed ascended the altar and solemnly took a seat on top. With
complete concentration, he recited silently the Heart Sūtra. Suddenly an official came
galloping on a horse with the question, “Why are you monks not striking the tablet and
burning charms?” Pilgrim answered in a loud voice, “No need for that! Ours is the quiet
work of fervent prayers.”
The official left to give this reply to the king, and we shall mention him no
further.
When Pilgrim heard that his old master had finished reciting the sūtra, he took
out his rod from his ear and one wave of it in the wind gave it a length of twelve feet
and the thickness of a rice bowl. He pointed it upwards in the air; when the Old Woman
of the Wind saw it, she immediately shook loose her bag as the Second Boy of the Wind
untied the rope around its mouth. The roar of the wind could be heard instantly, as tiles
and bricks flew up all over the city and stones and dust hurtled through the air. Just look
at it! It was truly marvelous wind, not at all similar to any ordinary breeze. You saw
Snapped willows and cracked flowers;
Fallen trees and toppled woods;
Nine-layered halls with chipped and broken walls;
A Five- Phoenix Tower of shaken pillars and beams;
The red sun losing its brightness in Heav‟n;
The yellow sand taking wings on Earth;
Alarmed warriors before the martial hall;
Frightened ministers in the letters bower;
Girls of three palaces with frowzy locks;
Beauties of six chambers with tousled hair.
Tassels dropped from gold caps of marquis and earls;
594
594
The prime minister‟s black gauze did spread its wings.
Attendants had words but they dared not speak;
The Yellow Gate held papers that could not be sent.
Goldfishes and jade belts stood not in rows;
Ivory tablets and silk gowns had broken ranks.
Colored rooms and turquoise screens were all damaged;
Green windows and scarlet doors were all destroyed.
Tiles of Golden Chimes Hall flew off with bricks;
Carved doors of Brocade- Cloud Hall all fell apart.
This violent wind was violent indeed!
It blew till king and subjects, fathers and sons, could not meet,
Till all streets and markets were emptied of men,
And doors of ten thousand homes were tightly shut.
As this violent gust of wind arose, Pilgrim Sun further revealed his magic
power. Giving his golden-hooped rod a twirl, he pointed it upwards a second time. You
saw
The Cloud- Pushing Boy,
The Fog- Spreading Lad—
The Cloud- Pushing Boy revealed his godly power
And a murky mass dropped down from Heaven;
The Fog- Spreading Lad displayed his magic might
And dense, soaring mists covered the Earth.
The three markets all grew dim;
The six avenues all turned dark.
With wind clouds left the seas
And Kunlun, trailing the rain.
Soon they filled Heav‟n and Earth
And blackened this world of dust.
Twas opaque like chaos of yore;
None could see Phoenix Tower‟s door.
As thick fog and dense clouds rolled in, Pilgrim Sun gave his golden-hooped rod
another twirl and pointed it upwards a third time. You saw
The Squire of Thunder raging,
The Mother of Lightning irate—
The Squire of Thunder, raging,
Rode a fiery beast backward to descend from Heaven‟s pass;
The Mother of Lightning, irate,
Wielded gold snakes madly as she left the Dipper Hall.
Hu-la-la cracked the thunder,
Shattering the Iron Fork Mountain;
Xi-li-li flashed the scarlet sheets,
Flying out of the Eastern Ocean.
Loud rumbles of chariots came on and off;
Like fires and fames the grains and rice shot up.
Myriad things sprouted, their spirits revived.
Countless insects were from dormancy aroused.
King and subjects both were terrified;
595

Traders and merchants were awed by the sound.
Ping-ping, pang-pang, the thunder flashed and roared so ferociously that it
seemed as if mountains were toppling and the earth was splitting apart. So terrified were
the city‟s inhabitants that every house lighted incense, that every home burned paper
money. “Old Deng,” shouted Pilgrim. “Take care to look out for those greedy and
corrupt officials, those churlish and disobedient sons. Strike down many of them for me
to warn the public!”
The peal of thunder grew louder than ever. Finally, Pilgrim pointed the iron rod
once more and you saw
The dragons gave order,
And rain filled the world,
Strong as Heavens river spilling o‟er the dikes,
Quick as the clouds rushing through a channel.
It pattered on top of towers;
It splashed outside the windows.
The Silver Stream ran down from Heaven,
And whitecaps surged through the streets.
It spurted like vases upturned;
It gushed forth like basins poured out.
With houses almost drowned in hamlets,
The water rose to rural bridges‟ height.
Truly mulberry fields became vast oceans,
And billows all too soon raced through the land.
Dragon gods came to lend a helping hand
By lifting up the Yangzi and throwing it down!
The torrential rain began in the morning and did not stop even after the noon
hour. So great was the downpour that all the streets and gulleys of the Cart Slow
Kingdom were completely flooded. The king therefore issued this decree:
“The rain‟s enough! If we had any more, it might damage the crops and that
would have made things worse.”
An official messenger below the Five-Phoenix Tower at once galloped through
the rain to make this announcement:
“Holy monk, we have enough rain.” When Pilgrim heard this, he pointed the
golden-hooped rod upwards once more and, instantly, the thunder stopped and the wind
subsided, the rain ended and the clouds dispersed. The king was filled with delight, and
not one of the various civil and military officials could refrain from marveling, saying,
“Marvelous priest! This is truly that „for the strong, there‟s someone stronger still!‟
Even when our Preceptors of State were capable of making the rain, a fine drizzle would
go on for virtually half a day before it stopped completely. How is it that the weather
can turn fair the moment the priest wants it to be fair? Look, the sun comes out instantly
and there is not a speck of cloud anywhere!”
The king gave the command for the carriage to be returned to the palace, for he
wanted to certify the travel rescript and permit the Tang Monk to pass through. Just as
he was about to use his treasure seal, the three Daoists all went forward and stopped
him, saying, “Your Majesty, this downpour of rain cannot be regarded as the monk‟s
merit, for it still owes its origin to the strength of the Daoist Gate.”

The king said, “You just claimed that the Dragon Kings were not home and that
was why it didn‟t rain. He walked up there, exercised his quiet work of fervent prayers,
and rain came down at once. How could you strive with him for credit?”
The Tiger-Strength Immortal said, “I issued my summons, burned my charms,
and struck my tablets several times after I ascended the altar. Which Dragon King
would dare not show up? It had to be that someone else somewhere was also requesting
their service, and that was the reason that the Dragon Kings along with the officers of
the other four bureaus—of wind, cloud, thunder, and lightning —did not appear at first.
Once they heard my summons, however, they were in a hurry to get here, and by that
time it happened that I was leaving the altar already. The priest, of course, made use of
the opportunity and it rained. But if you thought about the matter from the beginning,
the dragons were those which I summoned here and the rain was that which we called
for. How could you regard this, therefore, as their meritorious fruit?” When that dimwitted king heard these words, he became all confused again.
Pilgrim walked one step forward, and pressing his palms together he said, “Your
Majesty, this trivial magic of heterodoxy is hardly to be considered anything of
consequence. Let‟s not worry about whether it‟s his merit or ours. Let me tell you
instead that there are in midair right now the Dragon Kings of the Four Oceans; because
I have not dismissed them, they dare not withdraw. If that Preceptor of State could order
the Dragon Kings to reveal themselves, I would concede that this was his merit.” Very
pleased, the king said, “We have been on the throne for twenty-three years, but we have
never laid eyes on a living dragon. Both of you can exercise your magic power,
regardless whether you are a monk or a Daoist. If you could ask them to reveal
themselves, it would be your merit; if you couldn‟t, it would be your fault.”
Those Daoists, of course, had no such power or authority. Even if they were to
give the order, the Dragon Kings would never dare show themselves on account of the
presence of the Great Sage. Thus, the Daoists said, “We can‟t do this. Why don‟t you
try?” Lifting his face toward the air, the Great Sage cried out in a loud voice:
“Aoguang, where are you? All of you brothers, show your true selves!” When
those Dragon Kings heard this call, they at once revealed their original forms—four
dragons dancing through clouds and mists toward the Hall of Golden Chimes. You see
them
Soaring and transforming,
Encircling clouds and mists.
Like white hooks the jade claws hang;
Like bright mirrors the silver scales shine.
Whiskers float like white silk, each strand‟s distinct;
Horns rise ruggedly, each prong is clear.
Those craggy foreheads;
Those brilliant round eyes.
They, hidden or seen, can‟t be fathomed;
They, flying or soaring, can‟t be described.
Pray for rain, and rain comes instantly;
Ask for fair sky, and it‟s here at once.
Only these are the true dragon forms, most potent and holy,
Their good aura surrounds the court profusely.

The king lighted incense in the hall, and the various officials bowed down before
the steps. “It was most kind of you to show us your precious forms,” said the king.
“Please go back, and we shall say a special mass another day to thank you.”
“All of you deities may now retire,” said Pilgrim, “for the king has promised to
thank you with a special mass on another day.”
The Dragon Kings returned to the oceans, while the other deities all went back
to Heaven. Thus this is
The true magic might, so boundless and vast;
Heresy‟s pierced by nature enlightened.
We don‟t know how the deviant is finally exorcised; let‟s listen to the
explanation in the next chapter.
