        </p>
        <p>
            We were telling you about the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven, who was taken by
            the celestial guardians to the monster execution block, where he was bound to the
            monster-subduing pillar. They then slashed him with a scimitar, hewed him with an ax,
            stabbed him with a spear, and hacked him with a sword, but they could not hurt his
            body in any way. Next, the Star Spirit of the South Pole ordered the various deities of
            the Fire Department to burn him with fire, but that, too, had little effect. The gods of the
            Thunder Department were then ordered to strike him with thunderbolts, but not a single
            one of his hairs was destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The demon king Mahābāli and the others therefore went back to report to the
            Throne, saying, “Your Majesty, we don‟t know where this Great Sage has acquired such
            power to protect his body. Your subjects slashed him with a scimitar and hewed him
            with an ax; we also struck him with thunder and burned him with fire. Not a single one
            of his hairs was destroyed. What shall we do?” When the Jade Emperor heard these
            words, he said, “What indeed can we do to a fellow like that, a creature of that sort?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Laozi then came forward and said, “That monkey ate the immortal peaches and
            drank the imperial wine. Moreover, he stole the divine elixir and ate five gourdfuls of it,
            both raw and cooked. All this was probably refined in his stomach by the Samādhi fire
            to form a single solid mass. The union with his constitution gave him a diamond body,
            which cannot be quickly destroyed. It would be better, therefore, if this Daoist takes him
            away and places him in the Brazier of Eight Trigrams, where he will be smelted by high
            and low heat. When he is finally separated from my elixir, his body will certainly be
            reduced to ashes.”
        </p>
        <p>
            When the Jade Emperor heard these words, he told the Six Gods of Darkness
            and the Six Gods of Light to release the prisoner and hand him over to Laozi, who left
            in obedience to the divine decree. Meanwhile, the illustrious Sage Erlang was rewarded
            with a hundred gold blossoms, a hundred bottles of imperial wine, a hundred pellets of
            elixir, together with rare treasures, lustrous pearls, and brocades, which he was told to
            share with his brothers. After expressing his gratitude, the Immortal Master returned to
            the mouth of the River of Libations, and for the time being we shall speak of him no
            further.
        </p>
        <p>
            Arriving at the Tushita Palace, Laozi loosened the ropes on the Great Sage,
            pulled out the weapon from his breastbone, and pushed him into the Brazier of Eight
            Trigrams. He then ordered the Daoist who watched over the brazier and the page boy in
            charge of the fire to blow up a strong flame for the smelting process. The brazier, you
            see, was of eight compartments corresponding to the eight trigrams of Qian, Kan, Gen,
            Zhen, Xun, Li, Kun, and Dui. The Great Sage crawled into the space beneath the
            compartment that corresponded to the Xun trigram. Now Xun symbolizes wind; where
            there is wind, there is no fire. However, wind could churn up smoke, which at that
            moment reddened his eyes, giving them a permanently inflamed condition. Hence they
            were sometimes called Fiery Eyes and Diamond Pupils.
        </p>
        <p>
            Truly time passed swiftly, and the forty-ninth day arrived imperceptibly. The
            alchemical process of Laozi was perfected, and on that day he came to open the brazier
            to take out his elixir. The Great Sage at the time was covering his eyes with both hands,
            rubbing his face and shedding tears. He heard noises on top of the brazier and, opening
            his eyes, suddenly saw light. Unable to restrain himself, he leaped out of the brazier and
            kicked it over with a loud crash.
        </p>
        <p>
            He began to walk straight out of the room, while a group of startled fire tenders
            and guardians tried desperately to grab hold of him. Every one of them was overthrown;
            he was as wild as a white brow tiger in a fit, a one-horned dragon with a fever. Laozi
            rushed up to clutch at him, only to be greeted by such a violent shove that he fell head
            over heels while the Great Sage escaped. Whipping the compliant rod out from his ear,
            he waved it once in the wind and it had the thickness of a rice bowl. Holding it in his
            hands, without regard for good or ill, he once more careened through the Heavenly
            Palace, fighting so fiercely that the Nine Luminaries all shut themselves in and the Four
            Devarājas disappeared from sight. Dear Monkey Monster! Here is a testimonial poem
            for him. The poem says:
        </p>
        <p><em>
                This cosmic being fully fused with nature‟s gifts<br>
                Passes with ease through ten thousand toils and tests.<br>
                Vast and motionless like the One Great Void,<br>
                Perfect, quiescent, he‟s named the Primal Depth.<br>
                Long refined in the brazier, he‟s no mercury or lead,<br>
                Just the very immortal, living above all things.<br>
                Forever transforming, he changes still;<br>
                Three refuges and five commandments he all rejects.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>
                Here is another poem:
                A spirit beam filling the supreme void—
                That‟s how the rod behaves accordingly.
                It lengthens or shortens as one would wish;
                Upright or prone, it grows or shrinks at will.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            And another:
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>
                An ape‟s body of Dao weds the human mind.
                Mind is a monkey—this meaning‟s profound.
                The Great Sage, Equal to Heaven, is no false thought.
                How could the post of Ban-Horse justly show his gifts?
                “Horse works with Monkey” means both Mind and Will

                Need binding firmly. Don‟t seek them outside.
                All things back to Nirvāṇa follow one truth—
                To join Tathāgata beneath twin trees.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            This time our Monkey King had no respect for persons great or small; he lashed
            out this way and that with his iron rod, and not a single deity could withstand him. He
            fought all the way into the Hall of Perfect Light and was approaching the Hall of Divine
            Mists, where fortunately Numinous Officer Wang, aide to the Immortal Master of
            Adjuvant Holiness, was on duty. He saw the Great Sage advancing recklessly and went
            forward to bar his way, holding high his golden whip. “Wanton monkey,” he cried,
            “where are you going? I am here, so don‟t you dare be insolent!”
        </p>
        <p>
            The Great Sage did not wait for further utterance; he raised his rod and struck at
            once, while Numinous Officer met him also with brandished whip. The two of them
            charged into each other in front of the Hall of Divine Mists. What a fight that was
            between
        </p>
        <p>
            A red-blooded patriot of ample fame,
            And a Heaven‟s rebel with notorious name!
            The saint and sinner gladly tangle close
            So that two brave fighters can test their skills.
            Though the rod is fierce
            And the whip is fleet,
            How can the upright and just one forbear?
            This one is a supreme god of judgment with thunderous voice;
            The other, the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven, a monstrous ape.
            The golden whip and the iron rod used by the two
            Are both divine weapons from the House of God.
            At Divine Mists Treasure Hall they show their might today,
            Each displaying his prowess winningly.
            This one brashly seeks to take the Big Dipper Palace;
            The other with all his strength defends the sacred realm.
            In bitter strife relentless they show their power;
            Moving back and forth, whip or rod has yet to score.
        </p>
        <p>
            The two of them fought for some time, and neither victory nor defeat could yet
            be determined. The Immortal Master of Adjuvant Holiness, however, had already sent
            word to the Thunder Department, and thirty-six thunder deities were summoned to the
            scene. They surrounded the Great Sage and plunged into a fierce battle. The Great Sage
            was not in the least intimidated; wielding his compliant rod, he parried left and right and
            met his attackers to the front and to the rear. In a moment he saw that the scimitars,
            lances, swords, halberds, whips, maces, hammers, axes, gilt bludgeons, sickles, and
            spades of the thunder deities were coming thick and fast. So with one shake of his body
            he changed into a creature with six arms and three heads. One wave of the compliant
            rod and it turned into three; his six arms wielded the three rods like a spinning wheel,
            whirling and dancing in their midst. The various thunder deities could not approach him
            at all. Truly his form was
        </p>
        <p>
            Tumbling round and round,
            Bright and luminous;
            A form everlasting, how imitated by men?
            He cannot be burned by fire.
            Can he ever be drowned in water?
            A lustrous pearl of mani he is indeed,
            Immune to all the spears and the swords.
            He could be good;
            He could be bad;
            Present good and evil he could do at will.
            He‟d be an immortal, a Buddha, if he‟s good;
            Wickedness would cloak him with hair and horn.
            Endlessly changing he runs amok in Heaven,
            Not to be seized by fighting lords or thunder gods.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the time the various deities had the Great Sage surrounded, but they could not
            close in on him. All the hustle and bustle soon disturbed the Jade Emperor, who at once
            sent the Wandering Minister of Inspection and the Immortal Master of Blessed Wings to
            go to the Western Region and invite the aged Buddha to come and subdue the monster.
        </p>
        <p>
            The two sages received the decree and went straight to the Spirit Mountain.
            After they had greeted the Four Vajra-Buddhas and the Eight Bodhisattvas in front of
            the Treasure Temple of Thunderclap, they asked them to announce their arrival. The
            deities therefore went before the Treasure Lotus Platform and made their report.
            Tathāgata at once invited them to appear before him, and the two sages made obeisance
            to the Buddha three times before standing in attendance beneath the platform. Tathāgata
            asked, “What causes the Jade Emperor to trouble the two sages to come here?”
        </p>
        <p>
            The two sages explained as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
            “Some time ago there was born on the Flower-Fruit Mountain a monkey who
            exercised his magic powers and gathered to himself a troop of monkeys to disturb the
            world. The Jade Emperor threw down a decree of pacification and appointed him a
            Bimawen, but he despised the lowliness of that position and left in rebellion. Devarāja
            Li and Prince Naṭa were sent to capture him, but they were unsuccessful, and another
            proclamation of amnesty was given to him. He was then made the Great Sage, Equal to
            Heaven, a rank without compensation. After a while he was given the temporary job of
            looking after the Garden of Immortal Peaches, where almost immediately he stole the
            peaches. He also went to the Jasper Pool and made off with the food and wine,
            devastating the Grand Festival. Half-drunk, he went secretly into the Tushita Palace,
            stole the elixir of Laozi, and then left the Celestial Palace in revolt. Again the Jade
            Emperor sent a hundred thousand Heavenly soldiers, but he was not to be subdued.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thereafter Guanyin sent for the Immortal Master Erlang and his sworn brothers,
            who fought and pursued him. Even then he knew many tricks of transformation, and
            only after he was hit by Laozi‟s diamond snare could Erlang finally capture him. Taken
            before the Throne, he was condemned to be executed; but, though slashed by a scimitar
            and hewn by an ax, burned by fire and struck by thunder, he was not hurt at all. After
            Laozi had received royal permission to take him away, he was refined by fire, and the
            brazier was not opened until the forty-ninth day. Immediately he jumped out of the
            Brazier of Eight Trigrams and beat back the celestial guardians.
        </p>
        <p>
            He penetrated into the Hall of Perfect Light and was approaching the Hall of
            Divine Mists when Numinous Officer Wang, aide to the Immortal Master of Adjuvant
            Holiness, met and fought with him bitterly. Thirty-six thunder generals were ordered to
            encircle him completely, but they could never get near him. The situation is desperate,
            and for this reason, the Jade Emperor sent a special request for you to defend the
            Throne.” When Tathāgata heard this, he said to the various bodhisattvas, “All of you
            remain steadfast here in the chief temple, and let no one relax his meditative posture. I
            have to go exorcise a demon and defend the Throne.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Tathāgata then called Ānanda and Kāśyapa, his two venerable disciples, to
            follow him. They left the Thunderclap Temple and arrived at the gate of the Hall of
            Divine Mists, where they were met by deafening shouts and yells. There the Great Sage
            was being beset by the thirty-six thunder deities. The Buddhist Patriarch gave the
            dharma-order:
        </p>
        <p>
            “Let the thunder deities lower their arms and break up their encirclement. Ask
            the Great Sage to come out here and let me ask him what sort of divine power he has.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The various warriors retreated immediately, and the Great Sage also threw off
            his magical appearance. Changing back into his true form, he approached angrily and
            shouted with ill humor, “What region are you from, monk, that you dare stop the battle
            and question me?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Tathāgata laughed and said, “I am Śākyamuni, the Venerable One from the
            Western Region of Ultimate Bliss. I have heard just now about your audacity, your
            wildness, and your repeated acts of rebellion against Heaven. Where were you born, and
            in which year did you succeed in acquiring the Way? Why are you so violent and
            unruly?”
        </p>
        <p>
            The Great Sage said, “I was
            Born of Earth and Heaven, immortal divinely fused,
            An old monkey hailing from the Flower- Fruit Mount.
            I made my home in the Water-Curtain Cave;
            Seeking friend and teacher, I learned the Great Mystery.
            Perfected in the many arts of ageless life,
            I learned to change in ways boundless and vast.
            Too narrow the space I found on that mortal earth:
            I set my mind to live in the Green-jade Sky.
            In Divine Mists Hall none should long reside,
            For king may follow king in the reign of man.
            If might is honor, let them yield to me.
            He only is hero who dares to fight and win!”
        </p>
        <p>
            When the Buddhist Patriarch heard these words, he laughed aloud in scorn. “A
            fellow like you,” he said, “is only a monkey who happened to become a spirit. How
            dare you be so presumptuous as to want to seize the honored throne of the Exalted Jade
            Emperor? He began practicing religion when he was very young, and he has gone
            through the bitter experience of one thousand seven hundred and fifty kalpas, with each
            kalpa lasting a hundred and twenty-nine thousand six hundred years. Figure out yourself
            how many years it took him to rise to the enjoyment of his great and limitless position!
            You are merely a beast who has just attained human form in this incarnation. How dare
            you make such a boast? Blasphemy! This is sheer blasphemy, and it will surely shorten
            your allotted age.
        </p>
        <p>
            Repent while there‟s still time and cease your idle talk! Be wary that you don‟t
            encounter such peril that you will be cut down in an instant, and all your original gifts
            will be wasted.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Even if the Jade Emperor has practiced religion from childhood,” said the Great
            Sage, “he should not be allowed to remain here forever. The proverb says,
        </p>
        <p>
            Many are the turns of kingship:
            By next year the turn will be mine!
        </p>
        <p>
            Tell him to move out at once and hand over the Celestial Palace to me. That‟ll
            be the end of the matter. If not, I shall continue to cause disturbances and there‟ll never
            be peace!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Besides your immortality and your transformations,” said the Buddhist
            Patriarch, “what other powers do you have that you dare to usurp this hallowed region
            of Heaven?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “I‟ve plenty of them!” said the Great Sage. “Indeed, I know seventy-two
            transformations and a life that does not grow old through ten thousand kalpas. I know
            also how to cloud somersault, and one leap will take me one hundred and eight thousand
            miles. Why can‟t I sit on the Heavenly throne?”
        </p>
        <p>
            The Buddhist Patriarch said, “Let me make a wager with you. If you have the
            ability to somersault clear of this right palm of mine, I shall consider you the winner.
            You need not raise your weapon in battle then, for I shall ask the Jade Emperor to go
            live with me in the West and let you have the Celestial Palace. If you cannot somersault
            out of my hand, you can go back to the Region Below and be a monster. Work through
            a few more kalpas before you return to cause more trouble.” When the Great Sage heard
            this, he said to himself, snickering, “What a fool this Tathāgata is! A single somersault
            of mine can carry old Monkey one hundred and eight thousand miles, yet his palm is not
            even one foot across. How could I possibly not jump clear of it?”
        </p>
        <p>
            He asked quickly, “You‟re certain that your decision will stand?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Certainly it will,” said Tathāgata. He stretched out his right hand, which was
            about the size of a lotus leaf. Our Great Sage put away his compliant rod and,
            summoning his power, leaped up and stood right in the center of the Patriarch‟s hand.
            He said simply, “I‟m off!” and he was gone—all but invisible like a streak of light in the
            clouds. Training the eye of wisdom on him, the Buddhist Patriarch saw that the Monkey
            King was hurtling along relentlessly like a whirligig.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the Great Sage advanced, he suddenly saw five flesh-pink pillars supporting
            a mass of green air. “This must be the end of the road,” he said. “When I go back
            presently, Tathāgata will be my witness and I shall certainly take up residence in the
            Palace of Divine Mists.”
        </p>
        <p>
            But he thought to himself, “Wait a moment! I‟d better leave some kind of
            memento if I‟m going to negotiate with Tathāgata.”
        </p>
        <p>
            He plucked a hair and blew a mouthful of magic breath onto it, crying,
            “Change!” It changed into a writing brush with extra thick hair soaked in heavy ink. On
            the middle pillar he then wrote in large letters the following line:
        </p>
        <p>
            “The Great Sage, Equal to Heaven, has made a tour of this place.” When he had
            finished writing, he retrieved his hair, and with a total lack of respect he left a bubbling
            pool of monkey urine at the base of the first pillar. He reversed his cloud somersault and
            went back to where he had started. Standing on Tathāgata‟s palm, he said, “I left, and
            now I‟m back. Tell the Jade Emperor to give me the Celestial Palace.”
            “You pisshead ape!” scolded Tathāgata. “Since when did you ever leave the
            palm of my hand?”
        </p>
        <p>
            The Great Sage said, “You are just ignorant! I went to the edge of Heaven, and I
            found five flesh-pink pillars supporting a mass of green air. I left a memento there. Do
            you dare go with me to have a look at the place?”
        </p>
        <p>
            “No need to go there,” said Tathāgata. “Just lower your head and take a look.”
            When the Great Sage stared down with his fiery eyes and diamond pupils, he found
            written on the middle finger of the Buddhist Patriarch‟s right hand the sentence, “The
            Great Sage, Equal to Heaven, has made a tour of this place.”
        </p>
        <p>
            A pungent whiff of monkey urine came from the fork between the thumb and the
            first finger. Astonished, the Great Sage said, “Could this really happen? Could this
            really happen? I wrote those words on the pillars supporting the sky. How is it that they
            now appear on his finger? Could it be that he is exercising the magic power of
            foreknowledge without divination? I won‟t believe it! I won‟t believe it! Let me go
            there once more!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Dear Great Sage! Quickly he crouched and was about to jump up again, when
            the Buddhist Patriarch flipped his hand over and tossed the Monkey King out of the
            West Heaven Gate. The five fingers were transformed into the Five Phases of metal,
            wood, water, fire, and earth. They became, in fact, five connected mountains, named
            Five-Phases Mountain, which pinned him down with just enough pressure to keep him
            there. The thunder deities, Ānanda, and Kāśyapa all folded their hands and cried in
            acclamation:
        </p>
        <p>
            Praise be to virtue! Praise be to virtue!
        </p>
        <p>
            He learned to be human, born from an egg that year,
            And aimed to reap the authentic Way‟s fruit.
            He lived in a fine place by kalpas untouched.
            One day he changed, expending vim and strength.
            Craving high place, he flouted Heaven‟s reign,
            Mocked saints and stole pills, breaking great relations.
            Evil, full to the brim, now meets retribution.
            We know not when he may find release.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the Buddhist Patriarch Tathāgata had vanquished the monstrous monkey,
            he at once called Ānanda and Kāśyapa to return with him to the Western Paradise. At
            that moment, however, Tianpeng and Tianyou, two celestial messengers, came running
            out of the Treasure Hall of Divine Mists and said, “We beg Tathāgata to wait a moment,
            please! Our Lord‟s grand carriage will arrive momentarily.” When the Buddhist
            Patriarch heard these words, he turned around and waited with reverence. In a moment
            he did indeed see a chariot drawn by eight colorful phoenixes and covered by a canopy
            adorned with nine luminous jewels.
        </p>
        <p>
            The entire cortege was accompanied by the sound of wondrous songs and
            melodies, chanted by a vast celestial choir. Scattering precious blossoms and diffusing
            fragrant incense, it came up to the Buddha, and the Jade Emperor offered his thanks,
            saying, “We are truly indebted to your mighty dharma for vanquishing that monster. We
            beseech Tathāgata to remain for one brief day, so that we may invite the immortals to
            join us in giving you a banquet of thanks.” Not daring to refuse, Tathāgata folded his
            hands to thank the Jade Emperor, saying, “Your old monk came here at your command,
            Most Honorable Deva. Of what power may I boast, really? I owe my success entirely to
            the excellent fortune of Your Majesty and the various deities. How can I be worthy of
            your thanks?”
        </p>
        <p>
            The Jade Emperor then ordered the various deities from the Thunder Department
            to send invitations abroad to the Three Pure Ones, the Four Ministers, the Five Elders,
            the Six Women Officials, the Seven Stars, the Eight Poles, the Nine Luminaries, and
            the Ten Capitals. Together with a thousand immortals and ten thousand sages, they were
            to come to the thanksgiving banquet given for the Buddhist Patriarch. The Four Great
            Imperial Preceptors and the Divine Maidens of Nine Heavens were told to open wide
            the golden gates of the Jade Capital, the Treasure Palace of Primal Secret, and the Five
            Lodges of Penetrating Brightness. Tathāgata was asked to be seated high on the
            Numinous Terrace of Seven Treasures, and the rest of the deities were then seated
            according to rank and age before a banquet of dragon livers, phoenix marrow, juices of
            jade, and immortal peaches.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a little while, the Jade-Pure Celestial Worthy of Commencement, the HighestPure Celestial Worthy of
            Numinous Treasure, the Great-Pure Celestial Worthy of Moral
            Virtue, the Immortal Masters of Five Influences, the Star Spirits of Five Constellations,
            the Three Ministers, the Four Sages, the Nine Luminaries, the Left and Right Assistants,
            the Devarāja, and Prince Naṭa all marched in leading a train of flags and canopies in
            pairs. They were all holding rare treasures and lustrous pearls, fruits of longevity and
            exotic flowers to be presented to the Buddha. As they bowed before him, they said, “We
            are most grateful for the unfathomable power of Tathāgata, who has subdued the
            monstrous monkey. We are grateful, too, to the Most Honorable Deva, who is having
            this banquet and asked us to come here to offer our thanks. May we beseech Tathāgata
            to give this banquet a name?” Responding to the petition of the various deities,
            Tathāgata said, “If a name is desired, let this be called „The Great Banquet for Peace in
            Heaven.‟” “What a magnificent name!” the various Immortals cried in unison. “Indeed,
            it shall be the Great Banquet for Peace in Heaven.” When they finished speaking, they
            took their seats separately, and there was the pouring of wine and exchanging of cups,
            pinning of corsages and playing of zithers. It was indeed a magnificent banquet, for
            which we have a testimonial poem. The poem says:
        </p>
        <p>
            That Immortal Peach Feast the ape disturbed
            Is topped by this Banquet for Peace in Heav‟n.
            Dragon flags and phoenix carts glow in halos bright;
            Blazing signs and banners whirl in hallowed light.
            The tunes and songs divine are sweet and fair;
            Phoenix pipes and jade flutes both loudly play.
            Fragrant incense shrouds this assembly of saints.
            All the world‟s tranquil to praise the Holy Court.
        </p>
        <p>
            As all of them were feasting merrily, the Lady Queen Mother also led a host of
            divine maidens and immortal singing girls to come before the Buddha, dancing with
            nimble feet. They bowed to him, and she said, “Our Festival of Immortal Peaches was
            ruined by that monstrous monkey. We are beholden to the mighty power of Tathāgata
            for the enchainment of this mischievous ape. In the celebration during this Great
            Banquet for Peace in Heaven, we have little to offer as a token of our thanks. Please
            accept, however, these few immortal peaches plucked from the large trees by our own
            hands.” They were truly
        </p>
        <p>
            Half red, half green, and spouting aroma sweet,
            These luscious divine roots of ten thousand years.
            Pity those fruits planted at Wuling Spring!
            How could they match the marvels of Heaven‟s home:
            Those tender ones of purple veins so rare in the world,
            And those peerlessly sweet of pale yellow pits?
            They lengthen age, prolong life, and change your frame.
            He who‟s lucky to eat them will ne‟er be the same.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the Buddhist Patriarch had pressed together his hands to thank the Queen
            Mother, she ordered the immortal singing girls and the divine maidens to sing and
            dance. All the immortals at the banquet applauded enthusiastically. Truly there were
        </p>
        <p>
            Whorls of Heavenly incense filling the seats,
            And profuse array of divine petals and stems.
            Jade capital and golden arches in what great splendor!
            How priceless, too, the strange goods and rare treasures!
            Every pair had the same age as Heaven.
            Every set increased through ten thousand kalpas.
            Mulberry fields or vast oceans, let them shift and change.
            He who lives here has neither grief nor fear.
            The Queen Mother commanded the immortal maidens to sing and dance, as
            wine cups and goblets clinked together steadily. After a little while, suddenly
        </p>
        <p>
            A wondrous fragrance came to meet the nose,
            Rousing Stars and Planets in that great hall.
            The gods and the Buddha put down their cups.
            Raising his head, each waited with his eyes.
            There in the air appeared an aged man,
            Holding a most luxuriant long-life plant.
            His gourd had elixir often thousand years.
            His book listed names twelve millennia old.
            Sky and earth in his cave knew no constraint.
            Sun and moon were perfected in his vase.
            He roamed the Four Seas in joy serene,
            And made the Ten Islets his tranquil home.
            Getting drunk often at the Peaches Feast
            He woke; the moon shone brightly as of old.
            He had a long head, short frame, and large ears.
            His name: Star of Long Life from South Pole.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the Star of Long Life arrived and greeted the Jade Emperor, he also went
            up to thank Tathāgata, saying, “When I first heard that the baneful monkey was being
            led by Laozi to the Tushita Palace to be refined by alchemical fire, I thought peace was
            surely secured. I never suspected that he could still escape, and it was fortunate that
            Tathāgata in his goodness had subdued this monster. When I got word of the
            thanksgiving banquet, I came at once. I have no other gifts to present to you but these
            purple agaric, jasper plant, jade green lotus root, and golden elixir.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The poem says:
        </p>
        <p>
            Jade-green lotus and golden drug are given to Śākya.
            Like the sands of Ganges is the age of Tathāgata.
            The brocade of the three wains is calm, eternal bliss.
            The nine-grade garland is a wholesome, endless life.
            The true master of the Mādhyamika School
            Dwells in the Heaven of both form and emptiness.
            The great earth and cosmos all call him Lord.
            His sixteen-foot diamond frame‟s great in blessing and age.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tathāgata accepted the thanks cheerfully, and the Star of Long Life went to his
            seat. Again there was pouring of wine and exchanging of cups. The Great Immortal of
            Naked Feet also arrived. After prostrating himself before the Jade Emperor, he too went
            to thank the Buddhist Patriarch, saying, “I am profoundly grateful for your dharma,
            which subdued the baneful monkey. I have no other things to convey my respect but
            two magic pears and some lire dates, which I now present to you.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The poem says:
        </p>
        <p>
            The Naked- Feet Immortal brought fragrant pears and dates
            To give to Amitābha, whose count of years is long.
            Firm as a hill is his Lotus Platform of Seven Treasures;
            Brocadelike is his Flower Seat of Thousand Gold adorned.
            No false speech is this—his age equals Heaven and Earth;
            Nor is this a lie—his luck is great as the sea.
            Blessing and long life reach in him their fullest scope,
            Dwelling in that Western Region of calm, eternal bliss.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tathāgata again thanked him and asked Ānanda and Kāśyapa to put away the
            gifts one by one before approaching the Jade Emperor to express his gratitude for the
            banquet. By now, everyone was somewhat tipsy. A Spirit Minister of Inspection then
            arrived to make the report, “The Great Sage is sticking out his head!”
        </p>
        <p>
            “No need to worry,” said the Buddhist Patriarch. He took from his sleeve a tag
            on which were written in gold letters the words Oṁ maṇi padme hūṁ. Handing it over
            to Ānanda, he told him to stick it on the top of the mountain. This deva received the tag,
            took it out of the Heaven Gate, and stuck it tightly on a square piece of rock at the top of
            the Mountain of Five Phases. The mountain immediately struck root and grew together
            at the seams, though there was enough space for breathing and for the prisoner‟s hands
            to crawl out and move around a bit. Ānanda then returned to report, “The tag is tightly
            attached.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Tathāgata then took leave of the Jade Emperor and the deities, and went with the
            two devas out of the Heaven Gate. Moved by compassion, he recited a divine spell and
            called together a local spirit and the Fearless Guards of Five Quarters to stand watch
            over the Five-Phases Mountain. They were told to feed the prisoner with iron pellets
            when he was hungry and to give him melted copper to drink when he was thirsty. When
            the time of his chastisement was fulfilled, they were told, someone would be coming to
            deliver him. So it is that
        </p>
        <p>
            The brash, baneful monkey in revolt against Heaven
            Is brought to submission by Tathāgata.
            He drinks melted copper to endure the seasons,
            And feeds on iron pellets to pass the time.
            Tried by this bitter misfortune sent from the Sky,
            He‟s glad to be living, though in a piteous lot.
            If this hero is allowed to struggle anew,
            He‟ll serve Buddha in future and go to the West.
            Another poem says:
        </p>
        <p>
            Prideful of his power once the time was ripe,
            He tamed dragon and tiger, flaunting wily might.
            Stealing peaches and wine, he roamed Heaven‟s House.
            He found trust and grace in the City of Jade.
            He‟s now bound, for his evil‟s full to the brim.
            By good stock unfailing his breath will rise again.
            If he‟s indeed to flee Tathāgata‟s hands,
            He must await from Tang court the holy monk.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not know in what month or year hereafter the days of his penance will be fulfilled; let‟s listen to
            the explanation in the next chapter.
