THIRTY-TWO
On Level-Top Mountain the sentinel brings a message
At Lotus-Flower Cave Wood Mother meets disaster
We were telling you about the Tang Monk, who acquired again the service of
Pilgrim Sun; master and disciples thereupon embarked on the road to the West, united
once more in heart and mind. After they had rescued the princess of the Precious Image
Kingdom and been sent off by its king and officials, they journeyed without ceasing,
taking food and drink when they hungered and thirsted, resting by night and traveling
by day. Soon it was again the time of Triple Spring, a season when
Light breezes blow on willow green as silk,
A lovely scene most fit for verse.
The times hasten bird songs;
The warmth kindles flowers,
Fragrant blooms all around.
A pair of swallows comes to the apple court,
Just in time to enjoy spring:
Red dust on purple paths,
Strings, pipes, and the silk gowns,
Games and passing the wine cups.
As master and disciples walked and enjoyed the scenery, they found another
mountain barring their way. “Disciples,” said the Tang Monk, “please be careful. We
have a tall mountain before us, and I fear that tigers and wolves might be here to
obstruct us.”
“Master,” said Pilgrim, “a man who has left the family should not speak as those
who remain in the family. Don‟t you remember the words of the Heart Sūtra given to
you by that Crow‟s Nest Priest:
„No hindrances, and therefore, no terror or fear; he is far removed from error and
delusion‟? Only you must
Sweep away the filth of your mind,
And wash off the dust by your ears.
Not tasting the most painful of pain,
You‟ll never be a man among men.
You mustn‟t worry, for if you have old Monkey, everything will be all right
even if the sky collapses. Don‟t be afraid of any tiger or wolf!” Pulling in the reins of
his horse, the elder said, “Since I
Departed Chang‟an that year by decree,
My sole thought fixed on Buddha in the West—
That bright, golden image in Śārī-land,
Those jade-white brows in the pagoda blessed.
I searched through this world‟s waters without name;
I climbed all the mountains unscaled by man.
Fold upon fold the mists and waves extend,
When can I myself true leisure attain?”
411
411
When Pilgrim heard what he said, he roared with laughter, saying, “If Master
wants true leisure, it‟s not that difficult! When you achieve your merit, then all the
nidānas will cease and all forms will be but emptiness. At that time, leisure will come to
you most naturally.”
Hearing these words, the elder had to be content to put aside his anxiety and
urge his horse on. Master and disciples began to ascend the mountain, which was truly
rugged and treacherous. Marvelous mountain!
The tall, rugged peak;
The sharp, pointed summit.
Within the deep, winding brook—
Beside the lone, rugged cliff—
Within the deep, winding brook
You hear water loudly splashing as a serpent turns;
Beside the lone, rugged cliff
You see the big mountain tiger wagging its tail.
Look above:
The jutting peaks stab through the green sky.
Turn your eyes:
The canyon‟s deep and dark as the empyrean.
Start climbing:
It‟s like a ladder, a stair.
Walk down there:
It‟s like a moat, a ditch.
It‟s truly a weird, hillocked range;
It‟s indeed a steep-banked precipice.
On top of the hillocked range
The herb-picker is wary of walking;
Before the precipice
The woodsman finds it hard to move an inch!
Foreign goats and wild horses madly gallop;
Wily hares and mountain bulls seem to form in ranks.
The mountain‟s height does hide the sun and stars;
One often meets strange creatures and white wolves.
Through dense grassy path the horse can hardly pass.
How could one see Buddha at Thunderclap?
As the elder pulled back his horse to survey this mountain, which was so
difficult to ascend, he saw a woodcutter standing on the green slope above. “How was
he dressed?” you ask.
His head wore an old rain hat of blue felt;
He had on him a monk-robe of black wool.
The old rain hat of blue felt:
Indeed a rare thing to ward off sunlight and mists;
The monk-robe of black wool:
A sign of utter contentment rarely seen.
His hands held a steel ax polished highly;
He tied his machete-cut firewood firmly.
The spring hues at the ends of his pole
412
412
Quietly overflowed in all four seasons;
His carefree life as a recluse
Had always been blessed by the Three Stars.
He resigned himself to grow old in his lot.
What glory or shame could invade his world?
That woodcutter
Was just chopping firewood before the slope,
When the elder came abruptly from the East.
He stopped his ax to go out of the woods
And walked with big strides up the rocky ledge.
In a severe voice, he cried out to the elder, “The elder who is going toward the
West, please stop for a moment. I have something to tell you. There is a bunch of
vicious demons and cruel monsters in this mountain devoted to eating travelers who
come from the East and go toward the West.” When the elder heard what he said, his
spirit left him and his soul fled. He shook so violently that he could hardly sit on the
saddle.
Turning around quickly, he shouted to his disciples, “Did you hear what the
wood-cutter said about the vicious demons and cruel monsters? Which of you dare go
and ask him in greater detail?”
“Master, relax!” said Pilgrim. “Old Monkey will go and question him
thoroughly.”
Dear Pilgrim! He strode up the mountain and addressed the woodcutter as “Big
Brother” before bowing to him with folded hands.
The woodcutter returned his greeting, saying, “Elder, why did you people come
here?”
“To tell you the truth, Big Brother,” said Pilgrim, “we were sent from the Land
of the East to go acquire scriptures in the Western Heaven. That one on the horse is my
master.
He is rather timid; when he heard just now what you said about vicious demons
and cruel monsters, he asked me to question you. For how many years have there been
demons and monsters? Are they real professionals, or are they just amateurs? Let Big
Brother take the trouble to tell me, so that I may order the mountain god and the local
spirit to send them away in custody.” When the woodcutter heard these words, he faced
the sky and roared with laughter, saying, “So, you are really a mad monk!”
“I am not mad,” said Pilgrim, “and this is the honest truth.”
“If you are honest,” said the woodcutter, “how dare you talk about sending them
away in custody?” Pilgrim said, “The way you are magnifying their power, the way you
have stopped us with your foolish announcement and silly report, could it be that you
are somehow related to these monsters? If you are not a relative, you must be a
neighbor; if not a neighbor, you must be a friend.”
“You mad, impudent monk!” said the woodcutter, laughing. “You are so
unreasonable! My intentions were good and that was why I made a special effort to
bring this message to you, so that you could take precaution at all times when you
journey. Now you are blaming me instead. Let‟s not say just yet that I don‟t know
413
413
anything about the origin of those monsters. But suppose you have found that out, how
would you dispose of them? Where would you send them away in custody?”
“If they are demons from Heaven,” said Pilgrim, “I‟ll send them to see the Jade
Emperor. If they are demons of Earth, I‟ll send them to the Palace of Earth. Those of the
West will be returned to Buddha; those of the East will be returned to the sages; those of
the North will be returned to Zhenwu; those of the South will be returned to Mars.
If they are dragon spirits, they will be sent to the Lords of Oceans; if they are
ghosts and ogres, they will be sent to King Yama. Every class has its proper place and
direction, and old Monkey is familiar with all of them. All I need to do is to issue a
court order, and they will be sent off in a hurry. Even at night!”
The woodcutter could hardly stop his scornful laughter, saying, “You mad,
impudent monk! You must have made a pilgrimage to some place and learned some
paltry magic of drawing up charms and casting spells with water. You may be able to
drive away demons and suppress ghosts, but you have never run into such vicious and
cruel monsters.”
“In what way are they vicious and cruel?” asked Pilgrim. The woodcutter said,
“The length of this mountain range is about six hundred miles, and it‟s called the LevelTop Mountain.
In the mountain is a cave by the name of Lotus-Flower Cave. There are two old
demons in the cave who had portraits made with the intent to catch the priests, and who
had names and surnames written down because they insisted on eating the Tang Monk.
If you have come from another region, you might get by, but if you are in any way
associated with the word „Tang‟ you‟ll never pass here.”
“We are exactly those who have come from the Tang court,” said Pilgrim. The
woodcutter said, “And they specifically want to devour you.”
“Lucky! Lucky!” said Pilgrim. “How would they like to eat us?”
“Why do you ask?” said the woodcutter. “If they want to eat me headfirst,” said
Pilgrim, “it‟s still manageable, but if they want to eat me feetfirst, it‟ll be more
bothersome.”
The woodcutter asked, “What‟s the difference between eating you headfirst and
feetfirst?”
“You haven‟t experienced this,” replied Pilgrim. “If he eats me headfirst, one
bite will kill me, of course. Even if he were to fry, saute, braise, or boil me thereafter, I
wouldn‟t know the pain. But if he eats me feetfirst, he can start by munching on my
shanks and then proceed to gnaw on my thighs. He can devour me up to my pelvic
bones, and I still might not die in a hurry. Will I not be left to suffer bit by bit? That‟s
why it is bothersome.”
“Monk,” said the woodcutter, “he is not going to spend all that effort on you. All
he wants is to catch you and have you bound in a large steamer. Once you are cooked,
he‟ll eat you whole!”
“That‟s even better! That‟s even better!” said Pilgrim, chuckling. “There won‟t
be pain; I have to endure a little stuffiness, that‟s all.”
“Don‟t be so sassy, monk,” said the woodcutter, “for those monsters have with
them five treasures which possess tremendous magic powers. Even if you happen to be
the jade pillar that holds up the sky, or the golden bridge that spans the ocean, if you
414
414
want to protect the priest of the Tang court and pass this place safely, you will have to
become a little mad.”
“For how many times?” asked Pilgrim. “At least three or four times,” replied the
woodcutter. Pilgrim said, “That‟s nothing! Throughout a year, we must have become
mad for seven or eight hundred times. These three or four—what‟s that to us? A little
madness and we are through.”
Dear Great Sage! He was not at all afraid. Eager only to accompany the Tang
Monk, he abandoned the woodcutter and returned with big strides to where the horse
was standing before the mountain slope. “Master, it‟s nothing serious,” he said. “There
are a couple of puny monster-spirits, to be sure, but people around here are rather timid
and overly concerned. You have me, so why worry? Let‟s get going! Let‟s get going!”
When the elder heard what he said, he had no choice but to proceed. As they walked,
the woodcutter vanished.
The elder said, “Why did that woodcutter who brought us the message disappear
all at once?”
“Our luck must be rather poor,” said Eight Rules, “we have met a ghost in broad
daylight.”
“He must have crawled back into the forest to find firewood,” said Pilgrim. “Let
me take a look.”
Dear Great Sage! He opened wide his fiery eyes and diamond pupils to scan the
mountain far and near, but there was no trace of the woodcutter. He raised his head and
suddenly saw the Day Sentinel on the edge of the clouds. Mounting the clouds, he gave
chase immediately, shouting several times, “Clumsy devil!” When he caught up with
the deity, he said, “If you had something to say, why didn‟t you present yourself and
speak plainly? Why did you have to put on all that transformation to make fun of old
Monkey?”
The sentinel was so frightened that he bowed before he said, “Great Sage, please
do not take offense at my tardiness in bringing you the news. Those fiends do have great
magic powers, and they know many ways of transformation. It‟s up to you to use all
your cleverness, to exercise all your divine intelligence to guard your master carefully.
If you are the slightest bit negligent, you can‟t get through this road to reach the
Western Heaven.” When Pilgrim heard this, he drove away the sentinel, though the
words he kept firmly in his mind. Lowering the direction of his cloud, he returned to the
mountain. As he saw the elder proceeding with Eight Rules and Sha Monk, he thought
to himself, “If I give an honest account of what the sentinel said to Master, he will weep
for sure. He‟s so weak! If I don‟t tell him the truth, I can put something over him and
lead him forward. But as the proverb says, „Wading suddenly into a swamp, you can‟t
tell if it‟s deep or shallow.‟ If Master indeed were to be taken by the monsters, won‟t
old Monkey be asked to expend his energy again? Let me take good care of Eight Rules
instead. I‟m going to make him go and wage a battle with those monsters first and see
what happens; if he wins, we will consider that to be his merit. If his abilities are no
good and he is caught by the monsters, there will still be time for old Monkey to go
rescue him. I can display my powers then and further spread my fame.” Using the mind
to question the mind, he was thus deliberating with himself:
“I fear that Eight Rules is so lazy that he will refuse to volunteer his service.
Master, moreover, is so protective toward him. I‟ll have to use some gimmick.”
415
415
Dear Great Sage! Look at the chicanery he‟s resorting to! Rubbing his eyes for
awhile, he managed to squeeze out some tears as he walked back facing his master.
When Eight Rules saw that, he cried out at once, “Sha Monk, put down your pole. Bring
the luggage over here and we two will divide it up.”
“Second Elder Brother,” said Sha Monk, “Why divide it up?”
“Divide it!” said Eight Rules.
“You can then go back to the River of Flowing Sand and become a monster
again. Old Hog will return to the Old Gao Village to see how my wife is doing; we can
sell the white horse and buy a coffin for Master in preparation for his old age. All of us
can scatter. Why bother about going to the Western Heaven?” When the elder heard this
on the horse, he said, “This coolie! We are still journeying. What‟s all this babble?”
“Only your son babbles!” said Eight Rules. “Don‟t you see that Pilgrim Sun is
weeping over there as he walks toward us? He‟s a stalwart warrior who‟s not afraid of
hacking by the ax, burning by fire, or even a pot of boiling oil, one who can penetrate
Heaven and pierce the Earth.
Now he has put on a cap of sorrow and arrived gushing tears. It has to be that the
mountain is rugged, and that the monsters are truly vicious. How then do you expect
weaklings like us to proceed?”
The elder said, “Stop this nonsense! Let me question him and see what he says.”
He therefore asked, “Wukong, if you have something to say, let‟s discuss the
matter face to face. Why are you so distressed all by yourself? Are you trying to
frighten me with that tearful face of yours?”
“Master,” said Pilgrim, “just now the one who brought us the message happened
to be the Day Sentinel. He said that the monster-spirits were most vicious, making this
place a difficult one to pass through. It is indeed a treacherous road through a tall
mountain. I don‟t think we can go through it now; we may as well wait for another
time.” When the elder heard these words, he was greatly shaken. Tugging at Pilgrim‟s
tiger-skin kilt, he said, “Disciple, we have covered almost half the journey. Why are you
speaking such discouraging words?”
“I‟m not undevoted to our cause,” said Pilgrim, “but I fear that the demons are
many and my strength is limited if I have no help. As the saying goes, „Even if it‟s a
piece of iron in the furnace, how many nails can you beat out of it?‟” “Disciple,” said
the elder, “you have a point there. It is difficult for a single person to handle this matter,
for as the military book says, „The few cannot withstand the many.‟ But I have Eight
Rules and Sha Monk here, both my disciples. I permit you to command and use them as
you wish, so that they can serve as your helpers, someone to protect your flank. Only
you should work together to clear up a path and lead me across this mountain. Will we
not then be attaining the right fruit?”
All that legerdemain of Pilgrim, you see, was aimed at eliciting from the elder
these few words. He wiped away his tears, saying, “Master, if you want to cross this
mountain, Zhu Eight Rules has to agree to do two things for me. Only then will we have
about a third of a chance to get by. If he doesn‟t agree to help me, you might as well
forget about the whole matter.”
“Elder Brother,” said Eight Rules, “if we can‟t do it, let‟s scatter. Don‟t drag me
down.”
416
416
“Disciple,” said the elder, “let‟s ask your Elder Brother first and see what he
wants you to do.” Idiot indeed said to Pilgrim, “Elder Brother, what do you want me to
do?”
“The first thing is to look after Master,” said Pilgrim, “and the second is to go
patrol the mountain.”
Eight Rules said, “Looking after Master means sitting right here, whereas to
patrol the mountain means taking a walk somewhere. Do you want me to sit awhile and
walk awhile? How can I do two things at once?”
“I‟m not telling you to do two things at once,” said Pilgrim, “but to select one
only.”
“That‟s easier to decide,” said Eight Rules, chuckling, “but I don‟t know what‟s
involved in looking after Master or in patrolling the mountain. Tell me something of my
duties and I can then carry them out accordingly.”
“To look after Master,” said Pilgrim, “means that if he wants to move his
bowels, you wait on him; if he wants to journey, you assist him; if he wants to eat, you
go to beg for vegetarian food. If he suffers from hunger even slightly, you‟ll be beaten;
if he pales a little, you‟ll be beaten; if he loses some weight, you‟ll be beaten.”
Horrified, Eight Rules said, “This is terribly difficult! Terribly difficult! To wait
on him or to help him to walk—that‟s nothing, and even if I have to carry him bodily,
it‟s still an easy matter. But if he wants to send me to beg for food, I fear that there
might be those on this road to the West who won‟t recognize that I‟m a monk seeking
scriptures. They might think that I‟m a healthy hog just reaching maturity and then have
me surrounded by many people with brooms, rakes, pitchforks, and all. I‟ll be taken to
their homes, slaughtered, and cured for the new year. Wouldn‟t that be like meeting the
plague?”
“Then go and patrol the mountain,” said Pilgrim.
“What does that involve?” asked Eight Rules.
Pilgrim replied, “Go into the mountain and find out how many monsters there
are, what kind of mountain this is, and what kind of cave there is. We can then make
plans to pass through.”
“This is a small thing,” said Eight Rules. “Old Hog will go patrol the mountain.”
Hitching up his garment at once, Idiot held high his muckrake and strode
energetically up the road leading into the mountain.
As he watched Eight Rules leave, Pilgrim could not suppress his giggles. “You
impudent ape!” scolded the elder. “As a brother, you haven‟t shown the least bit of
sympathy or kindness. You are constantly envious of one another. With all that base
cunning, all those „clever words and an ingratiating appearance,‟ you have managed to
trick him already into the so-called patrolling the mountain. Now you are even mocking
him with your laugh!”
“I‟m not mocking him,” said Pilgrim, “because there‟s another meaning in my
laughter. You see that Eight Rules has left, but he will not go to patrol the mountain, nor
will he dare to face the monsters. He will go instead somewhere to hide for awhile and
then come back to deceive us with some story that he has made up.”
417
417
“How do you know that about him?” asked the elder. Pilgrim replied, “I suspect
that‟s how he will behave. If you don‟t believe me, let me follow him and find out. I can
also lend him some assistance in subduing the monsters, and see at the same time
whether he is earnest in seeking the Buddha.”
“Fine! Fine! Fine!” said the elder, “but you must not play tricks on him.”
Pilgrim agreed and ran up the slope of the mountain. Shaking his body once, he changed
into a tiny mole cricket, indeed a delicate and lightsome transformation. You see
Thin wings dance in the wind without effort;
A small waist sharp as a pin.
He darts through rushes and the floral shades
Faster than even a comet.
Eyes that are shining bright;
A voice that‟s soft and faint.
Of insects he‟s one of the smallest:
Slender, shapely, and sly.
A few times he rests idle in the secluded woods—
His whole body out of sight,
Lost to a thousand eyes.
Spreading his wings, he flew with a buzz up there, caught up with Eight Rules,
and alighted on his neck beneath the bristles behind his ear. Idiot was intent on
traveling; how could he know that someone had landed on his body? After walking for
seven or eight miles, he dropped his muckrake, turned around, and faced the direction of
the Tang Monk. Gesturing vehemently with hands and feet, he began to let loose a
string of abuses. “You doddering old priest!” he said. “You unscrupulous Ban-HorsePlague! You sissy Sha Monk! All of you are enjoying yourselves, but you trick old Hog
into stumping the road. All of us seeking the scriptures hope to attain the right fruit, but
you have to make me do this so-called patrolling the mountain. Ha, ha, ha! If there are
monsters known to be in this place, we should have taken cover and tried to get by
undetected. But that‟s not sufficient for you; you have to make me go find them instead!
Well, that‟s your bad luck! I‟m going to find some place and take a nap. When I am
through sleeping, I‟ll go back and give you a vague story about having patrolled the
mountain, and that will be that!” It was the good fortune of the moment for Idiot. As he
walked further along, carrying his muckrake, he discovered a clump of red grass in the
fold of the mountain. He crawled inside at once and used his muckrake to create for
himself some sort of floor mat. Lying down and stretching himself, he said, “O joy!
Even that Ban-Horse-Plague is not as comfortable as I am now!”
But Pilgrim, you see, who had stationed himself behind his ear, heard every
word. No longer able to contain himself, Pilgrim flew up and decided to badger him a
little. With one shake of his body he changed again into a small woodpecker. You see
A fine bill iron hard and glossy red
And bright, gleaming patterned plumage.
Owning a pair of steel claws sharp as nails,
Famished he fears not quiet woods.
He loves best the dried trunks worm-rotted;
He cares, too, for the lonely old tree.
Round-eyed, fan-tailed, he‟s very perky—
His pecking sounds are worth hearing!
418
418
This creature was neither too big nor too small, weighing perhaps only several
ounces. Armed with a red bronze-hard bill and black iron claws, he hurtled straight
down from the air. Eight Rules was just sleeping soundly with head upturned when his
snout received a terrific bite. So startled was Idiot that he scampered up at once, madly
shouting, “A monster! A monster! He stabbed me with the lance! Oh, my mouth is
sore!”
He rubbed it with his hands and blood spurted out. “That‟s weird!” he said, “I‟m
not involved in any happy event. Why has my mouth been painted red?”
He stared at his bloody hands, muttering to himself confusedly, but he could not
detect the least trace of movement around him. He said, “There‟s no monster. Then why
was I stabbed by a lance?”
He raised his head to look upward and suddenly discovered a small woodpecker
flying in the air. Gritting his teeth, Idiot shouted, “You wretched outcast! Isn‟t it enough
that Ban-Horse-Plague should oppress me? Why must you, too, oppress me? Ah, I
know! He must not have recognized that I‟m a human, thinking instead that my snout is
a charred, rotted tree trunk with worms inside. He‟s looking for worms to eat and that‟s
why he gives me a bite. Let me hide my snout in my chest.”
Tumbling on the ground, Idiot again lay down to sleep. Pilgrim flew down once
more and gave the base of his ear another bite.
Alarmed, Idiot jumped up, saying, “This wretched outcast! He‟s really harassing
me! This must be where his nest is located, and he‟s worried that I have taken his eggs
or offspring. That‟s why he‟s harassing me. All right! All right! All right! I‟m not going
to sleep anymore.” Poling his rake, he left the red grass meadow and started up the road
again. Meanwhile, Pilgrim Sun nearly broke up with amusement, the Handsome
Monkey King almost collapsed with laughter. “This coolie!” he said. “Even those wide
open eyes couldn‟t recognize one of his own!”
Dear Great Sage! Shaking his body and changing again into a mole cricket, he
attached himself firmly to Idiot‟s ear once more.
After walking four or five miles deep into the mountain, Idiot came upon in a
valley three square slabs of green rock, each about the size of a table. Putting down his
rake, Idiot bowed deeply to the rocks. Laughing silently to himself, Pilgrim said, “This
Idiot! The rocks are no humans; they know neither how to talk nor how to return his
greeting. Why bow to them? That‟s truly blind homage!”
But Idiot, you see, pretended that the rocks were the Tang Monk, Sha Monk, and
Pilgrim. Facing the three of them, Idiot was rehearsing what he would say. Said he,
“This time when I go back to see Master, I‟ll say that there are monsters, should they
ask me. And if they ask me what kind of mountain this is, I‟ll say that it‟s molded of
clay, made of mud, wrought of tin, forged by copper, steamed with flour, plastered with
paper, and painted with the brush. If they claim that I‟m speaking idiotic words, I‟m
going to say some more. I‟ll say that this is a rocky mountain. If they ask me what sort
of a cave there is, I‟ll say there is a rocky cave. If they ask me what kind of doors there
are, I‟ll say there are sheet-iron doors studded with nails. If they ask me how deep is the
cave inside, I‟ll say that there are some three sections in the dwelling. If they persist in
trying to learn everything, such as how many nails there are on the door, I‟ll only say
that old Hog is too preoccupied to remember the exact number. Well, now that I have
everything all made up, I‟m going to go back to hoodwink that Ban-Horse-Plague.”
419
419
Having fabricated his story, Idiot dragged his rake along to retrace his steps. He
did not know, however, that Pilgrim heard everything behind his ear. When Pilgrim saw
him turning back, he stretched his wings and flew back first, changing back to his
original form to see his master. “Wukong, so you have come back,” said the master.
“Why don‟t we see Wuneng also?”
“He‟s just making up some lies,” said Pilgrim, chuckling. “He‟ll be here soon.”
The elder said, “A person like him who has his eyes covered by his ears has to
be a stupid fellow. What sort of lies can he make up? It‟s got to be some hum-buggery
of yours again, trying to put the blame on him.”
“Master,” said Pilgrim, “you are always covering up his faults. What I have to
tell you, however, is based on evidence.”
He thereupon gave a complete account of how Idiot crawled into the clump of
grass to sleep and was bitten by the woodpecker, and how he bowed to the rocks and
made up the story on monster-spirits in the rocky mountain, in the rocky cave with the
sheet-iron doors.
After he finished, Idiot came walking back in a little while. As he was afraid that
he might forget what he had made up, he was still rehearsing with head bowed when
Pilgrim shouted at him, “Idiot, what are you reciting?” Sticking up his ears so that he
could glance around, Eight Rules said, “I‟m back at the old homestead!”
He went forward and knelt down, but the elder raised him up, saying, “Disciple,
you must be tired!”
“Yes,” said Eight Rules, “the person who walks or climbs mountains is the one
most tired.”
“Are there any monsters?” asked the elder. Eight Rules said, “Yes, yes! There is
a whole bunch of them!”
“How did they treat you?” asked the elder. Eight Rules said, “They called me
Ancestor Hog and Grandfather Hog; they also prepared some vegetarian food and soup
noodles for me to eat, saying that they would put on a big parade to take us across this
mountain.”
“Could this be your talking in your dreams, after you have fallen asleep in the
grass?” asked Pilgrim. When Idiot heard the question, he was so astounded that he
almost lost two inches of his height, saying, “O Father! How could he know about my
sleeping?” Pilgrim went forward and caught hold of him, saying, “You come over here!
Let me ask you!” Idiot became even more alarmed; trembling all over, he said, “You
can ask me anything. Why do you have to grab me like that?”
“What kind of a mountain is there?” asked Pilgrim. Eight Rules said, “It‟s a
rocky mountain.”
“What kind of a cave?”
“It‟s a rocky cave,” he said. “What kind of doors are there?” Pilgrim asked.
“There are sheet-iron doors studded with nails,” he said. “How deep is the cave inside?”
“There are three sections inside,” he said. “No need for you to say any more,”
said Pilgrim. “I can remember the last part quite clearly, but because I fear that Master
still won‟t believe me, I‟ll say that for you.”
420
420
“You sneak!” said Eight Rules. “You didn‟t even go with me! What do you
know that you can say for me?”
“How many nails are there on the doors?” said Pilgrim, laughing, “Just say that
old Hog is too preoccupied to remember clearly. Isn‟t that about right?” Idiot was so
frightened that he fell on his knees at once. Pilgrim said, “You bowed to the rocks and
began speaking to them as if they were the three of us. Isn‟t that right? You also said,
„Let me make up this story so that I can go hoodwink that Ban-Horse-Plague.‟ Isn‟t that
right also?”
“Elder Brother,” said Idiot, kowtowing unceasingly, “could it be that you
accompanied me when I went to patrol the mountain?”
“You overstuffed coolie!” scolded Pilgrim. “This is an important area. We asked
you to go patrol the mountain, and you went to sleep instead. If the woodpecker hadn‟t
jabbed you up, you would still be sleeping there. After you were roused, you even made
up such a big lie. You could completely ruin our important enterprise, couldn‟t you?
Stick out your shanks at once, and you‟ll receive five strokes of the rod as a keepsake.”
Horrified, Eight Rules said, “That funeral staff is very heavy: a little touch and
my skin will collapse, a little brush and my tendons will snap. Five strokes mean certain
death for me.” Pilgrim said, “If you are afraid of being beaten, why do you lie?”
“Elder Brother,” said Eight Rules, “it‟s just this once. I‟ll never dare do that
again.”
“All right,” said Pilgrim, “I‟ll give you just three strokes this time.”
“O Father!” said Eight Rules. “I can‟t even bear half a stroke!” Without any
alternative, Idiot caught hold of the master and said, “You must speak for me.”
The elder said, “When Wukong told me that you were making up this lie, I
would not believe him. Now that it is really so, you certainly deserve to be beaten. But
we are trying to cross this mountain at the moment, and we need everyone we can use.
So Wukong, you may as well spare him now. Let‟s cross the mountain first, and then
you can beat him.” Pilgrim said, “The ancients said, „To obey the sentiments of one‟s
parents is to perform a great filial act.‟ If Master tells me not to beat you, I‟ll spare you
for the moment. You must go to patrol the mountain again. If you start lying and botch
things up once more, I‟ll not spare you from even one stroke!” Idiot had no choice but
to scamper up and leave on the main road. Look at him! As he walked along this time,
he was haunted by suspicion, supposing with every step of the way that the transformed
Pilgrim was following him. As soon as he came upon an object or thing, he would
immediately suspect that it was Pilgrim. After he had gone for about seven or eight
miles, he saw a tiger running across the slope. Undaunted, he lifted up his muckrake and
said, “Elder Brother, did you come again to listen to my fibs? I told you I wouldn‟t do
that anymore.”
As he walked further, a violent mountain gust toppled a dead tree, which rolled
up to him. Pounding his chest and stamping his feet, he cried, “Elder Brother! Why did
you do this? I told you I would not try to deceive you anymore. Why did you have to
change into a tree to strike at me?”
He proceeded still further and saw in the air a white-necked old crow, which
squawked several times overhead. He said again, “Elder Brother, aren‟t you ashamed of
yourself? I told you I wouldn‟t lie anymore.

Why did you still change into an old crow? Are you trying to eavesdrop on me
again?”
But this time Pilgrim, you see, did not follow him; he was simply ridden with
suspicion and surmise, and we shall speak no more of him for the moment.
We now tell you about the mountain, which was named Level-Top Mountain, in
which there was a cave called the Lotus-Flower Cave. There were two fiends in the
cave: one had the name of the Great King Golden Horn and the other, the Great King
Silver Horn.
As they sat in the cave that day, Golden Horn said to Silver Horn, “Brother, how
long has it been since we patrolled the mountain?” Silver Horn said, “It‟s been half a
month.”
“Brother,” said Golden Horn, “go and patrol it today.” Silver Horn said, “Why
today?”
“You don‟t know what I heard recently,” said Golden Horn, “that the Tang
emperor in the Land of the East had sent his royal brother, the Tang Monk, to worship
Buddha in the West. He has three other companions by the names of Pilgrim Sun, Zhu
Eight Rules, and Sha Monk; including the horse, there are five of them altogether. Go
see where they are and capture them for me.” Silver Horn said, “If we want to eat
people, we can catch a few anywhere. Where can these monks be? Let them pass.”
Golden Horn said, “You don‟t know about this. The year when I left the
Heavenly Region, I heard people say that the Tang Monk is the incarnation of the Elder
Gold Cicada, a man who has practiced religion for ten existences, and one who has not
allowed any of his yang energy to be dissipated. If anyone can have a taste of his flesh,
his age will be vastly lengthened.”
“If eating his flesh,” said Silver Horn, “can lengthen our age and prolong our
lives, what need we to practice sedentary meditation, to arrive at certain attainment, to
cultivate the dragon and the tiger, or to achieve the union of the male and the female?
We should just eat him. Let me go and catch him at once.”
Golden Horn said, “Brother, you are rather impulsive. Let‟s not hurry. If you
walk out this door and grab any monk that comes along, you would be breaking the law
unnecessarily if he were not the Tang Monk. I still recall how the real Tang Monk
looks. Let‟s have portraits made of the master and his disciples that you can take along
with you. When you see some monks, you can check whether they are the real ones.”
He thereupon had portraits drawn up, and the name of each person was written
beside the picture.
Taking the sketches with him, Silver Horn left the cave after calling up thirty
little fiends to follow him to patrol the mountain.
We now tell you about Eight Rules, whose fortune was about to take a turn for
the worse. As he walked along, he ran right into the various demons, who barred his
way and asked, “Who is he that‟s approaching?” Raising his head and pushing his ears
aside, Idiot saw that they were demons and he became quite frightened. He said to
himself, “If I say that I‟m a monk going to seek scriptures, they may want to seize me.
I‟d better say I‟m only a traveler.”
The little fiends reported back to their master, saying, “Great King, it‟s a
traveler.”
422
422
Among those thirty little fiends, there were some who did not recognize Eight
Rules. There were a few, however, who found his face somewhat familiar, and pointing
at him, they said, “Great King, this monk looks like the portrait of Zhu Eight Rules.”
The old fiend told them at once to hang up the picture so that they could
examine it more closely. When Eight Rules saw it, he was greatly shaken, muttering to
himself, “No wonder I feel somewhat dispirited of late! They have caught my spirit in
this portrait!”
As the little fiends held up the picture with their spears, Silver Horn pointed with
his hand, saying, “This one riding the white horse is the Tang Monk, and this one with a
hairy face is Pilgrim Sun.”
Hearing this, Eight Rules said, “City Guardian, it‟s all right if I‟m not included!
I‟ll present you with three hog‟s heads, twenty-four portions of pure libation . . .”
Mumbling to himself repeatedly, he kept making all sorts of vows.
The fiend, meanwhile, went on to say, “That long dark one is Sha Monk, and
this one having a long snout and huge ears is Zhu Eight Rules.” When Idiot heard what
he said, he was so startled that he lowered his snout toward his chest and tried to
conceal it. “Monk, stick out your mouth,” cried the fiend. “It‟s a birth defect,” said
Eight Rules. “I can‟t stick it out.”
The fiend told the imps to pull it out with hooks, and Eight Rules became so
alarmed that he stuck out his snout at once, saying, “It‟s no more than a homely feature!
Here it is! If you want to look at it, just look. Why do you want to use hooks?”
Recognizing that it was Eight Rules, the fiend took out his precious blade and hacked
away. Idiot parried the blow with his rake, saying, “My child, don‟t be brazen! Watch
my rake!”
The fiend said with a chuckle, “This man became a monk in the middle of life.”
“Dear child!” said Eight Rules. “You do have some intelligence! How do you
know right away that your father became a monk in the middle of life?”
“If you know how to use the rake,” said the fiend, “you must have stolen it after
hoeing the fields or gardens of some household.”
Eight Rules said, “My child, you won‟t recognize the rake of your father, for it is
not like any ordinary rake for hoeing the ground. We have here
Huge teeth made in the shape of dragon claws,
Adorned with gold and like a tiger formed.
When used in battle it draws down cold wind;
When brought to combat it emits bright flames.
It can for Tang Monk all barriers remove,
Catch all monsters on this road to the West.
When it‟s wielded, mists hide the sun and moon;
When it‟s held high, clouds make dim the pole stars.
It knocks down Mount Tai and tigers panic;
It o‟erturns oceans and dragons cower.
Though you, monster, may have many skills,
One rake will nine bloody holes produce!”
The fiend heard the words, but he was not ready to step aside. Wielding his
sword of seven stars, he charged Eight Rules and they closed in again and again in the
423
423
mountain. Even after some twenty rounds, neither appeared to be the stronger one.
Growing more and more fierce, Eight Rules began to fight as if he had no regard
whatever for his life. When the fiend saw how his opponent flapped his huge ears and
spat out saliva, whooping and yelling all the time, he became somewhat frightened. He
therefore turned around to call up all his little fiends to do battle. Now, if it were a oneto-one combat, it would have been manageable for Eight Rules. But when he saw all
those little fiends approaching, he panicked and turned to flee. The road, however, was
not very smooth and he immediately tripped over some vines and dried creepers along
the way. As he was struggling to run, one of the little fiends made a flying tackle at his
legs, and he hit the ground headfirst like a dog eating shit! The others swarmed all over
him, pressing him on the ground, pulling at his mane and his ears, grabbing his legs, and
tugging at his tail. They hoisted him up bodily to return to the cave. Alas! Thus it is that
A whole body bursting with demons is hard to destroy;
Ten thousand ills arise, they are tough to remove.
We do not know what happens to the life of Zhu Eight Rules; let‟s listen to the
explanation in the next chapter.
