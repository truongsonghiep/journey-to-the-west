FIFTY-SEVEN
True Pilgrim lays bare his woes at Mount Potalaka
False Monkey King transcribes texts at Water-Curtain Cave
We were telling you about a dejected Great Sage Sun, who rose into midair. He
was about to return to the Water-Curtain Cave of the Flower-Fruit Mountain, but he was
afraid that those little fiends might laugh at him, for how could he be a true hero if he
could betray his own word? He thought of seeking shelter in the celestial palace, but he
feared that he would not be given permission to stay there long. He next thought of the
islands in the sea, but then he was ashamed to face the resident immortals. Finally, he
considered the dragon palace, but he could not stomach the idea of approaching the
dragon kings as a suppliant. Truly, he had absolutely no place to go, and he thought
sadly to himself, “All right! All right! All right! I‟ll go to see my master again, for only
that will bear the right fruit.”
He dropped down from the clouds and went before the horse of Tripitaka,
saying, “Master, please forgive this disciple one more time! I‟ll never dare work
violence again. I promise I‟ll accept all your admonitions, and I beg you to let me
accompany you to the Western Heaven.” When the Tang Monk saw him, however, he
even refused to reply. As soon as he reined in the horse, he recited the Tight-Fillet Spell.
Over and over again, he went through it for more than twenty times until the Great Sage
fell prostrate to the ground, the fillet cutting an inch into his flesh. Only then did the
elder stop and say, “Why don‟t you leave? Why have you come to bother me again?”
Pilgrim could only reply, “Don‟t recite anymore! Don‟t recite anymore! I can spend my
days somewhere, but without me I fear that you can‟t reach the Western Heaven.”
Growing angry, Tripitaka said, “You are a murderous ape! Heaven knows how
many times you‟ve brought troubles on me! I absolutely don‟t want you anymore.
Whether I can reach there or not, it‟s no concern of yours. Leave quickly! If you don‟t,
I‟ll start the magic word again, and this time, I won‟t stop—not until your brains are
squeezed out!” When the Great Sage saw that his master refused to change his mind,
and as the pain was truly unbearable, he had no alternative but to mount his cloud
somersault once more and rise into the air. Then he was struck by the thought:
“If this monk is so ungrateful to me, I‟ll go to the Bodhisattva Guanyin at Mount
Potalaka and tell on him.”
Dear Great Sage! He turned his somersault around and in less than an hour
reached the Great Southern Ocean. Lowering his auspicious luminosity, he descended
on the Potalaka Mountain and sped at once into the purple bamboo grove. There he was
met by the disciple Mokṣa, who greeted him, saying, “Where is the Great Sage going?”
“I must see the Bodhisattva,” replied Pilgrim. Mokṣa led him to the entrance of
the Tidal Sound Cave, where the Boy Skilled in Wealth also greeted him, saying, “Why
has the Great Sage come here?”
“I have something to tell on the Bodhisattva,” Pilgrim said.
When he heard the words “to tell on,”
Skilled in Wealth laughed and said, “What a smart-mouthed ape! You think you
can oppress people just like the time I caught the Tang Monk. Our Bodhisattva is a holy
745
745
and righteous goddess, one who is of great compassion, great promise, and great
conveyance, one who with boundless power saves us from our sufferings. What has she
done that you want to bring an accusation against her?” Pilgrim was already deeply
depressed; what he heard only aroused him to anger and he gave such a snarl that the
Boy Skilled in Wealth backed off at once. “You wicked, ungrateful little beast!” he
shouted. “You are so dimwitt ed! You were once a fiend, a spirit, but it was I who asked
the Bodhisattva to take you in. Since you have made your submission to the Right, you
have been enjoying true liberty and long life—an age as everlasting, in fact, as
Heaven‟s. Instead of thanking me, how dare you be so insulting? I said that I was going
to tell something on the Bodhisattva. How dare you say that I‟m smart-mouthed?”
Trying to placate him with a smile, Skilled in Wealth said, “You‟re still an
impulsive ape! I was just teasing you. Why do you change color so suddenly?”
As they were thus conversing, a white cockatoo came into view, flying back and
forth before them for a couple of times, and they knew that this was the summons of the
Bodhisattva. Whereupon Mokṣa and Skilled in Wealth led the way to the treasure lotus
platform. As Pilgrim went to his knees to bow to the Bodhisattva, he could no longer
restrain the tears from gushing forth and he wailed loudly. Asking Mokṣa to lift him up,
the Bodhisattva said, “Wukong, tell me plainly what‟s causing you such great sorrow.
Stop crying! I‟ll relieve your suffering and dispel your woe.” Pilgrim, still weeping,
bowed again before he said, “In previous years, when has your disciple ever consented
to be snubbed by anyone? When, however, I was liberated by the Bodhisattva from my
Heaven-sent calamity, and when I took the vow of complete poverty to accompany the
Tang Monk on his way to see Buddha for scriptures in the Western Heaven, I was
willing to risk my very life. To rescue him from his demonic obstacles was like
Snatching a tender bone from the tiger‟s mouth,
Scraping off one scale, live, from a dragon‟s back.
My only hope was to be able to return to the Real and attain the right fruit, to
cleanse myself of sins and destroy the deviates. How could I know that this elder could
be so ungrateful! He cannot recognize any virtuous cause, nor can he distinguish
between black and white.”
“Tell me,” said the Bodhisattva, “a little about the black and white.” Whereupon
Pilgrim gave a thorough account of how he had beaten to death the brigands, which
provoked the misgivings of the Tang Monk; how without distinguishing black and
white, the Tang Monk had used the Tight-Fillet Spell to banish him several times; and
how he had to come to lay bare his woes to the Bodhisattva because there was no place
on Earth or in Heaven where he could find refuge. Then the Bodhisattva said to him:
“When Tripitaka Tang received the imperial decree to journey to the West, his
sole intention was to be a virtuous monk, and therefore he most certainly would not
lightly take even one human life. With your limitless magic power, why should you beat
to death these many bandits? Those brutish bandits are no good, to be sure, but they are,
after all, human beings and they don‟t deserve such punishment. They are not like those
fiendish fowl or monstrous beasts, those demons or griffins. If you kill or slaughter
those things, it‟s your merit, but when you take human lives, then it‟s your wickedness.
Just frighten them away, and you would still be able to protect your master. In my
opinion, therefore, you have not acted in a virtuous manner.” Still tearful, Pilgrim
kowtowed and said, “Though I may not have acted in a virtuous manner, I should have
been given a chance to use my merit to atone for my sins. I don‟t deserve to be banished
like this. I beg now the Bodhisattva to have compassion on me and recite the Loose-
746
746
Fillet Spell. Let me be released from the golden fillet and I‟ll give it back to you. Let me
go back to the Water-Curtain Cave with my life.” Smiling at him, the Bodhisattva
replied, “The Tight-Fillet Spell was imparted to me originally by Tathāgata, who sent
me in that year to go find a scripture pilgrim in the Land of the East. He gave me three
kinds of treasure: the brocade cassock, the nine-ringed priestly staff, and three fillets
named the golden, the tight, and the prohibitive. I was also taught in secret three
different spells, but there was no such thing as the Loose-Fillet Spell.”
“In that case,” said Pilgrim, “let me take leave of the Bodhisattva.”
The Bodhisattva asked, “Where are you going?”
“To the Western Heaven,” replied Pilgrim, “where I‟ll beg Tathāgata to recite
the Loose-Fillet Spell.”
“Wait a moment,” said the Bodhisattva, “and let me scan the fortune for you.”
“No need for that,” said Pilgrim. “This sort of misfortune is all I can take!”
“I‟m not scanning yours,” said the Bodhisattva, “but the Tang Monk‟s.”
Dear Bodhisattva! As she sat solemnly on the lotus platform, her mind
penetrated the three realms and her eyes of wisdom surveyed from a distance the entire
universe. In a moment, she opened her mouth and said, “Wukong, your master will soon
encounter a fatal ordeal. Before long, he will be looking for you, and I will tell him then
to take you back so that both of you can acquire the scriptures to attain the right fruit.”
The Great Sage Sun had no choice but to obey; not daring to misbehave, he
stood at attention beneath the lotus platform where we shall leave him for the moment.
We tell you now about the elder Tang, who, after he had banished Pilgrim, told
Eight Rules to lead the horse and Sha Monk to pole the luggage. All four of them
headed toward the West. When they had traveled some fifty miles, Tripitaka stopped the
horse and said, “Disciples, we left the village at the early hour of the fifth watch, and
then that Ban-Horse-Plague made me terribly upset. After this half a day, I‟m quite
hungry and thirsty. Which of you will go beg me some food?”
“Please dismount, Master,” said Eight Rules, “and let me see if there‟s a village
nearby for me to do so.” On hearing this, Tripitaka climbed down from the horse, while
Idiot rose on the clouds. As he stared all around, he found mountains everywhere, but
there was not a single house in sight. Dropping down, Eight Rules said to Tripitaka,
“There‟s no place to beg food. I couldn‟t see a village anywhere.”
“If there‟s no place to beg food,” said Tripitaka, “let‟s get some water for my
thirst.”
Eight Rules said, “I‟ll go fetch some water from the brooklet south of the
mountain.” Sha Monk therefore handed the almsbowl over to him, and supporting it
with his palm, Eight Rules left on the clouds and fog. The elder sat by the road to wait
for him, but after a long while, he still did not return. The bitter thirst, alas, was
becoming quite unbearable, for which we have a testimonial poem. The poem says:
To nurse breath and spirit, that‟s extraction:
Feelings and nature are in form the same.
Ailments arise from spirit and mind distraught;
When shape and sperm fail, the Way declines.
Three flowers fizzle and your labor‟s vain;
747
747
All Four Greats wither and you strive for naught.
Earth and wood sterile, metal and water die.
When will true self, so sluggish, be attained?
When Sha Monk saw how greatly Tripitaka was suffering from his hunger and
thirst, and Eight Rules still had not returned with the water, he had no alternative but to
put down the wraps and tie up the white horse. Then he said, “Master, please sit here for
a moment; let me go and see if I can hurry him back with the water.”
Tears welling up in his eyes, the elder could only nod his head to give his reply.
Quickly mounting the cloudy luminosity, Sha Monk also headed for the south of the
mountain.
As he sat there all by himself enduring his agonies, the elder suddenly heard a
loud noise near him. He was so startled that he jumped up, and then he saw that Pilgrim
Sun was kneeling on one side of the road, his two hands holding high a porcelain cup.
“Master,” he said, “without old Monkey, you don‟t even have water. This is a
cup of nice, cool water. Drink it to relieve your thirst, and let me then go beg some food
for you.”
“I won‟t drink your water!” replied the elder. “If I die of thirst on the spot, I‟ll
consider this my martyrdom! I don‟t want you anymore! Leave me!”
“Without me,” said Pilgrim, “you can‟t go to the Western Heaven.”
“Whether I can or not,” said Tripitaka, “is no business of yours! Lawless ape!
Why are you bothering me again?”
Changing his color all at once, that Pilgrim became incensed and shouted at the
elder, “You cruel bonze! How you humiliate me!”
He threw away the porcelain cup and slammed the iron rod on the back of the
elder, who fainted immediately on the ground. Picking up the two blue woolen wraps,
the monkey mounted his cloud somersault and went off to some place.
We now tell you about Eight Rules, who went to the south slope of the mountain
with his almsbowl. As he passed the fold of the mountain, a thatched hut, the sight of
which had been blocked previously by the mountain, came into view. He walked up to it
and discovered that this was some sort of human residence. Idiot thought to himself, “I
have such an ugly face. They will no doubt be afraid of me and refuse to give me any
food. I must use transformation . . .”
Dear Idiot! Making the magic sign with his fingers, he recited a spell and shook
his body seven or eight times. At last he changed into a yellowish, consumptive monk,
still rather stoutish. Moaning and groaning, he staggered up to the door and called out:
“Patron,
If your kitchen has surplus rice,
Let it starved wayfarers suffice.
This humble cleric is from the Land of the East, on his way to seek scriptures in
the Western Heaven. My master, now sitting by the road, is hungry and thirsty. If you
have any cold rice or burnt crusts, I beg you to give us some.” Now, the men of the
household, you see, had all gone to plant the fields, and only two women remained
behind. They had just finished cooking lunch and filled two large bowls with rice to be
sent to the fields, while some rice and crusts were still in the pot.
748
748
When they saw his sickly appearance, and when they heard all that muttering
about going to the Western Heaven from the Land of the East, they thought that he was
babbling because of his illness. Afraid, moreover, that he might fall dead right before
their door, the women hurriedly packed the almsbowl with the leftovers, crust and all,
which Idiot gladly received. After he left on the road from which he came, he changed
back into his original form.
As he proceeded, he heard someone calling, “Eight Rules!” Raising his head, he
found that it was Sha Monk, standing on a cliff and shouting, “Come this way! Come
this way!”
Then he leaped down from the cliff and approached Eight Rules, saying,
“There‟s lovely, clean water here in the brook. Why didn‟t you bail some? Where did
you run off to?”
“When I reached here,” said Eight Rules, chuckling, “I saw a house in the fold
of the mountain. I went there and succeeded in begging from them this bowl of dried
rice.”
“We can use that,” said Sha Monk, “but Master is terribly thirsty. How can we
bring back some water?”
“That‟s easy,” replied Eight Rules.
“Fold up the hem of your robe, and we‟ll use that to hold the rice. I‟ll take the
alms-bowl to bail some water.” In great spirits, the two of them went back to the spot by
the road, where they saw Tripitaka lying down with his face hugging the earth. The
reins were loosened, and the white horse was rearing up and neighing repeatedly by the
road. The pole with the luggage, however, was nowhere to be seen. Eight Rules was so
shaken that he stamped his feet and beat his breast, shouting, “This has to be it! This has
to be it! The cohorts of those bandits whom Pilgrim Sun beat to death must have
returned to kill Master and take the luggage.”
“Let‟s tie up the horse first,” said Sha Monk, and then he too began to shout:
“What shall we do? What shall we do? This is truly the failure that comes in
midway!”
As he turned to call but once “Master,” tears streamed down his face and he
wept bitterly. “Brother,” said Eight Rules, “stop crying. When we have reached this
stage of affairs, let‟s not talk about that scripture business. You watch over Master‟s
corpse, and let me ride to some village store in whatever county or district nearby and
see if I can buy a coffin. Let‟s bury Master and then we can disperse.” Unwilling,
however, to give up on his master, Sha Monk turned the Tang Monk over on his back
and put his own face up to the corpse‟s face. “My poor master!” he wailed, and
presently, the elder‟s mouth and nose began to belch hot air as a little warmth could also
be felt on his chest. “Eight Rules,” cried Sha Monk hurriedly, “come over here.
Master‟s not dead!” Our Idiot approached them and lifted up the elder, who woke up
slowly, groaning all the time. “You lawless ape!” he exclaimed. “You‟ve just about
struck me dead!”
“Which ape is this?” asked both Sha Monk and Eight Rules, and the elder could
do nothing more than to sigh. Only after he drank several gulps of water did he say,
“Disciples, soon after both of you left, that Wukong came to bother me again. Because I
adamantly refused to take him back, he gave me a blow with his rod and took away our
blue woolen wraps.” When Eight Rules heard this, he clenched his teeth as fire leaped
749
749
up from his heart. “This brazen ape!” he said. “How could he be so insolent? Sha Monk,
you look after Master and let me go to his home to demand the wraps.”
“Stop being so angry,” said Sha Monk.
“We should take Master to that house in the fold of the mountain and beg for
some hot liquids to warm up the rice we managed to get just now. Let‟s take care of
Master first before you go look for him.”
Eight Rules agreed; after having helped their master to mount up, they held the
almsbowl and carried the cold rice up to the house‟s door, where they found only an old
woman inside. Seeing them, she quickly wanted to hide. Sha Monk pressed his palms
together and said, “Old Mama, we are those from the Land of the East sent by the Tang
court to go to the Western Heaven. Our master is somewhat indisposed, and that is why
we have come here especially to your house to beg some hot tea or water, so that he
may eat some rice.”
“Just now,” said the old woman, “there was a consumptive monk who claimed
to have been sent from the Land of the East. We have already given him some food.
How is it that you are also from the Land of the East? There‟s no one in the house.
Please go to someplace else.” On hearing this, the elder held onto Eight Rules and
dismounted. Then he bent low and said, “Old Popo, I had originally three disciples, who
were united in their efforts to accompany me to see Buddha for scriptures at the Great
Thunderclap Monastery in India. My eldest disciple, whose name is Sun Wukong, has
unfortunately practiced violence all his life and refused to follow the virtuous path. For
this reason, I banished him. Little did I expect him to return in secret and give my back
a blow with his rod. He even took our luggage and our clothing. I must now send a
disciple to go find him and ask for our things, but the open road is no place to sit. Hence
we have come to ask your permission to use your house as a temporary resting place. As
soon as we get back our luggage, we‟ll leave, for we dare not linger.”
“But there was a yellowish, consumptive monk just now,” said the old woman,
“who received our food. He also claimed to be part of a pilgrimage going to the Western
Heaven from the Land of the East. How could there be so many of you?” Unable to
restrain his giggles, Eight Rules said, “That was I. Because I have this long snout and
huge ears, I was afraid that your family might be frightened and refuse me food. That
was why I changed into the form of that monk. If you don‟t believe me, just take a look
at what my brother‟s carrying in the fold of his robe. Isn‟t that your rice, crust and all?”
When the old woman saw that it was indeed the rice that she had given him, she no
longer refused them and asked them to go inside and take a seat. She then prepared a pot
of hot tea, which she gave to Sha Monk for him to mix with the rice. After the master
had eaten several mouthfuls, he felt more calm and said, “Which of you will go ask for
the luggage?”
“In that year when Master sent him back there,” said Eight Rules, “I went to
look for him. So I know the way to his Flower-Fruit Mountain and the Water-Curtain
Cave.
Let me go! Let me go!”
“You can‟t go!” replied the elder. “That monkey has never been friendly with
you, and you are so rough with your words. A tiny slip when you talk to him and he
may want to attack you. Let Wujing go.”
750
750
“I‟ll go! I‟ll go!” said Sha Monk agreeably, whereupon the elder gave him this
further instruction:
“You must size up the situation as soon as you get there. If he‟s willing to give
you our wraps, just pretend to thank him and take them. If he‟s unwilling, be sure not to
argue or fight with him. Go directly to the Bodhisattva‟s place at the South Sea and tell
her everything. Ask the Bodhisattva to demand the luggage from him.”
After he had listened most attentively, Sha Monk said to Eight Rules, “When
I‟m gone, you must not be slack in your care of Master. And don‟t cause any mischief
in this family, for I fear that they would not serve you rice then. I‟ll be back soon.”
“I know,” said Eight Rules, nodding. “But you must come back quickly, whether
you succeed or not in getting our things back. I don‟t want something to happen like
„Hauling firewood with a pointed pole: you lose at both ends‟!”
And so, Sha Monk made the magic sign and mounted the cloudy luminosity to
head for the East Pūrvavideha Continent. Truly,
Body‟s here but spirit has flown its lodge.
How could fireless oven heat elixir?
Yellow Dame leaves her lord to seek Metal Squire;
Wood Mother bids a teacher in sickly looks.
This journey‟s of unknown returning date,
A time, hard to surmise, of coming home.
Five Phases work no smooth conquest or growth.
Wait till Mind Monkey reenters the pass.
Only after he had traveled in the air for three nights and days did Sha Monk
finally reach the Great Eastern Ocean. As the sound of waves reached his ears, he
lowered his head and saw that
Black fog swelling skyward makes the dark air dense;
The brine holds the sun to chill the light of dawn.
He was, of course, too preoccupied to enjoy the scenery. Passing the immortal
island of Yingzhou, he hurried toward the Flower-Fruit Mountain, riding on the oceanic
wind and tide.
After a long while, he saw towering peaks jutting up like rows of halberds and
sheer cliffs like hanging screens. He dropped down on the highest summit and began to
search for his way to the Water-Curtain Cave. As he drew near his destination, he began
to hear a noisy din made by countless monkey spirits living in the mountain. Sha Monk
walked closer and found Pilgrim Sun sitting high on a rock terrace, his two hands
holding up a piece of paper from which he was reading aloud the following statement:
Emperor Li, King of the Great Tang in the Land of the East, now commands the sage monk, Chen
Xuanzang, royal brother before the throne and master of the Law, to go to India in the West, and ask for
scriptures in all sincerity from the Buddhist Patriarch, Tathāgata, in the Great Thunderclap Monastery on
the Spirit Mountain.
Because of grave illness invading our body, our soul departed for the region of Hades. It was our good
fortune to have our life span unexpectedly lengthened, and the Kings of Darkness kindly returned us to
life. Whereupon we convened a vast and goodly assembly to erect a Plot of the Way for the redemption of
the dead. We were indebted to the salvific and woe-dispelling Bodhisattva Guanshiyin, who appeared to
us in her golden form and revealed that there were both Buddha and scriptures in the West, which could
deliver and redeem the lost souls of the dead. We have, therefore, commissioned Xuanzang, master of the
Law, to traverse a thousand mountains in order to acquire such scriptures. When he reaches the various
751
751
states of the Western region, we hope that they will not destroy such goodly affinity and allow him to
pass through on the basis of this rescript.
This is an imperial document promulgated on an auspicious day in the autumn of the thirteenth year in the
Zhenguan reign period of the Great Tang.
Since leaving my noble nation, I have passed through several countries, and in midjourney, I have made
three disciples: the eldest being Pilgrim Sun Wukong, the second being Zhu Wuneng Eight Rules, and the
third being Sha Wujing Monk.
After he read it aloud once, he started again from the beginning. When Sha
Monk realized that it was the travel rescript, he could no longer contain himself.
Drawing near, he shouted:
“Elder Brother, this is Master‟s rescript. Why are you reading it like that?”
When that Pilgrim heard this, he raised his head but could not recognize Sha Monk.
“Seize him! Seize him!” he yelled. The other monkeys immediately had Sha Monk
surrounded; pulling and tugging at him, they hauled him before that Pilgrim, who
bellowed, “Who are you, that you dare approach our immortal cave without
permission?” When Sha Monk saw how he had changed color and refused to recognize
his own, he had little choice but to bow low and say, “Let me inform you, Elder
Brother. Our master previously was rather impetuous and wrongly put the blame on
you. He even cast the spell on you several times and banished you home. Your brothers
did not really try to pacify Master for one thing, and for another, we soon had to look
for water and beg for food because of Master‟s hunger and thirst. We didn‟t expect you
to come back with all your good intentions. When you took offense at Master‟s adamant
refusal to take you in again, you struck him down, left him fainted on the ground, and
took the luggage. After we rescued him, I was sent to plead with you. If you no longer
hate Master, and if you can recall his previous kindness in giving you freedom, please
give us back the luggage and return with me to see Master. We can go to the Western
Heaven together and accomplish the right fruit. But if your animosity is deep and you
are unwilling to leave with me, please give me back the wraps at least. You can enjoy
your old age in this mountain, and you will have done at the same time all of us a very
good turn.” When he heard these words, that Pilgrim laughed scornfully and said,
“Worthy Brother, what you said makes little sense to me. I struck the Tang Monk and I
took the luggage not because I didn‟t want to go to the West, nor because I loved to live
in this place. I‟m studying the rescript at the moment precisely because I want to go to
the West all by myself to ask Buddha for the scriptures. When I deliver them to the
Land of the East, it will be my success and no one else‟s. Those people of the South
Jambūdvīpa Continent will honor me then as their patriarch and my fame will last for all
posterity.”
“You have spoken amiss, Elder Brother,” said Sha Monk, smiling, “Why, we
have never heard anyone speaking of „Pilgrim Sun seeking scriptures‟! When our
Buddha Tathāgata created the three canons of true scriptures, he also told the
Bodhisattva Guanyin to find a scripture pilgrim in the Land of the East. Then she
wanted us to traverse a thousand hills and search through many states as protectors of
that pilgrim. The Bodhisattva once told us that the scripture pilgrim was originally
Tathāgata‟s disciple, whose religious designation was the Elder Gold Cicada. Because
he failed to listen attentively to a lecture of the Buddhist Patriarch, he was banished
from the Spirit Mountain to be reborn in the Land of the East. He was then instructed to
bear the right fruit in the West by cultivating once more the great Way. Since it was
preordained that he should encounter many demonic obstacles in his journey, we three
were liberated so that we might become his guardians. If Elder Brother does not wish to
752
752
accompany the Tang Monk in his quest, which Buddhist Patriarch would be willing to
impart to you the scriptures? Haven‟t you dreamed up all this in vain?”
“Worthy Brother,” said that Pilgrim, “you‟ve always been rather blockish! You
know one thing, but you fail to perceive another. You claim that you have a Tang Monk
who needs both of us to protect him. Do you really think that I don‟t have a Tang
Monk? I have already selected here a truly enlightened monk, who will go acquire the
scriptures and old Monkey will only help him. Is there anything wrong with that? We
have, in fact, decided that we‟ll begin the journey tomorrow. If you don‟t believe me, let
me show you.”
He then cried:
“Little ones, ask the old master to come out quickly please.”
The little fiends indeed ran inside and led out a white horse, followed by a
Tripitaka Tang, an Eight Rules poling the luggage, and a Sha Monk carrying the priestly
staff.
Enraged by the sight, Sha Monk cried, “Old Sand here changes neither his name
when he walks nor his surname when he sits. How could there be another Sha Monk?
Don‟t be impudent! Have a taste of my staff!”
Dear Sha Monk! Lifting high his fiend-routing staff with both his hands, he
killed the specious Sha Monk with one blow on the head. He was actually a monkey
spirit. That Pilgrim, too, grew angry; wielding his golden-hooped rod, he led the other
monkeys and had Sha Monk completely surrounded. Charging left and right, Sha Monk
managed to fight his way out of the encirclement. As he fled for his life by mounting the
cloud and fog, he said to himself:
“This brazen ape is such a rogue! I‟m going to see the Bodhisattva to tell on
him!” When that Pilgrim saw that the Sha Monk had been forced to flee, he did not give
chase. He went back to his cave instead and told his little ones to have the dead monkey
skinned. Then his meat was taken to be fried and served as food along with coconut and
grape wines. After they had their meal, that Pilgrim selected another monkey monster
who knew transformation to change into a Sha Monk. He again gave them instructions
on how to go to the West, and we shall leave them for the moment.
Once Sha Monk had left the Eastern Ocean by mounting the clouds, he reached
the South Sea after journeying for a day and night.
As he sped forward, he saw the Potalaka Mountain approaching, and he stopped
his cloud to look around. Marvelous place it was! Truly
This secret spot of Heaven,
This hidden depth of Earth,
Where a hundred springs join to bathe both sun and stars,
Where the wind blows as the moon beams her rippling light.
When the tide rises, the great fishes change:
When the waves churn, the huge scorpaenids swim.
Here water joins the northwest sea,
Its billows the Eastern Ocean fuse.
The four seas are linked by the same Earth pulse;
Each isle immortal has its fairy homes.
Speak not of Penglai every where.
Let‟s look at Cave Potalaka.
753
753
What fine scenery!
The peak‟s bright colors show prime essence strong.
Auspicious breeze wafts moonlight beneath the ridge.
Through groves of purple bamboo peacocks fly;
On willow-branch a sentient parrot speaks.
Jade grass, jasper flowers bloom fair each year:
Gold lotus, jewelled trees grow annually.
A few times the white cranes fly up the peak;
The phoenix comes often to the mount-kiosk.
E‟en fishes by nature seek authentic Truth,
For to hear scriptures they leap through the waves.
Descending slowly from the Potalaka Mountain as he admired the scenery, he
was met by the disciple, Mokṣa, who said to him, “Sha Wujing, why aren‟t you
accompanying the Tang Monk to procure scriptures? Why are you here?”
After Sha Monk returned his bow, he said, “I have a matter that requires my
having an audience with the Bodhisattva. Please take the trouble to announce me.”
Mokṣa already knew that it had to do with his search for Pilgrim, but he did not mention
it. He went instead inside first and said to the Bodhisattva, “The youngest disciple of the
Tang Monk, Sha Wujing, is outside seeking an audience.” When Pilgrim Sun heard that
beneath the platform, he chuckled and said, “This has to be that the Tang Monk has met
some kind of ordeal, and Sha Monk is here to seek the assistance of the Bodhisattva.”
The Bodhisattva at once asked Mokṣa to call him in, and Sha Monk went to his
knees to kowtow. After his bow, he raised his head and was about to tell the Bodhisattva
what had happened, when all of a sudden he saw Pilgrim Sun standing on one side.
Without even a word, Sha Monk whipped out his fiend-routing staff and aimed it at
Pilgrim‟s face. Pilgrim, however, did not fight back; he only stepped aside to dodge the
blow. “You brazen ape!” screamed Sha Monk. “You rebellious simian guilty of ten evil
deeds! So, you are even here to hoodwink the Bodhisattva!”
“Wujing!” shouted the Bodhisattva. “Don‟t raise your hands! If you have a
complaint, tell it to me first.” Putting away his treasure staff, Sha Monk knelt down
before the platform, and, still huffing, said to the Bodhisattva, “This monkey has
performed countless violent acts along the way. The day before, he beat two
highwaymen to death beneath the mountain slope, and Master already found fault with
him. Little did we expect that that very night we had to live right in the bandit camp,
and he slaughtered a whole band of them. As if that weren‟t enough, he took a bloody
head back to show to Master, who was so aghast that he fell down from his horse. It was
then that Master gave him a reprimand and banished him. After we separated, Master
found the hunger and thirst unbearable at one place and told Eight Rules to go find
water. When he didn‟t return after a long while, I was told to go find him. When Pilgrim
Sun saw that we both had left, he sneaked back and gave Master a blow with his iron
rod, after which he took away our two blue woolen wraps. When we finally returned,
we managed to revive Master, and then I had to make a special trip to his Water-Curtain
Cave to demand from him the wraps. How could I know that he would change his face
and refuse to recognize me? Instead, he was reciting back and forth the travel rescript of
Master. When I asked him why, he said that he was no longer willing to accompany the
Tang Monk. He wanted to go procure sciptures in the Western Heaven and take them all
by himself to the Land of the East. That, he said, would be his sole merit, and the people
would honor him as their patriarch while his fame would be everlasting. I told him,

„Without the Tang Monk, who would be willing to give you scriptures?‟ He said then
that he had already selected a true, enlightened monk, and he brought out a Tang Monk,
all right, including a white horse, followed by an Eight Rules and a Sha Monk for me to
see. „I‟m the Sha Monk,‟ I said, „so how could there be another Sha Monk?‟ I rushed up
to this impostor and gave him a blow with my treasure staff; it turned out to be a
monkey spirit. Then this ape led his followers to try to capture me, and that was when I
fled and decided to come here to inform the Bodhisattva. He must have used his cloud
somersault and arrived first, and I don‟t know what sort of balderdash he has mouthed
to dupe the Bodhisattva.”
“Wujing,” said the Bodhisattva, “don‟t blame another person wrongly. Wukong
has been here for four days, and I haven‟t let him go anywhere. How could he have
gone to find another Tang Monk to go fetch scriptures by themselves?”
“But,” said Sha Monk, “I saw a Pilgrim Sun in the Water-Curtain Cave. You
think I‟m lying?”
“In that case,” said the Bodhisattva,“don‟t get upset. I‟ll tell Wukong to go with
you to take a look at the Flower-Fruit Mountain. Truth is indestructible, but falsehood
can easily be eliminated. When you get there, you‟ll find out.” On hearing this, our
Great Sage and Sha Monk took leave at once of the Bodhisattva and left. And so, the
result of their journey will be that
Before Mount Flower- Fruit black and white will be made distinct;
By the Water-Curtain Cave the true and perverse will be seen.
We don‟t know, however, how that will be accomplished; let‟s listen to the
explanation in the next chapter.
