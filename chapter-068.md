*Virtue attained, all causations dead,
Your fame through four great continents will spread.
Wise and enlightened you ascend yonder shore.
The wind will sigh
As hazy cirrus rises in the sky.
Those Buddhas will all greet you;
Forever at Jade Terrace you'll live thereto.
Break up the human dream of butterfly.
Let it all end!
Where dust is cleansed no worries attend.
We we telling you about Tripitaka and his disciples who,
Having washed out an alley of sullage,
Now walked on the path of freedom.
Time went by swiftly and again it was torrid summer, when
Pomegranates spread ornate fruits,
And lotus leaves split like green pans.
In two rows of willow young swallows hide,
To flee the heat the travellers wave their fans.*

As they proceeded, they suddenly saw a moated city looming up. Reining in his horse, Tripitaka called out, *"Disciples, take a look. What kind of a place is that?"*

*"Master,"* said Pilgrim, *"so you are actually illiterate! How could you have accepted the decree of the Tang emperor to leave the court?"*

*"I became a priest when I was still a child,"* replied Tripitaka. *"I have mastered thousands of sūtras. How could you say I'm illiterate?"*

*"If you are literate,"* said Pilgrim, *"why couldn't you recognize those three big words written plainly on the apricot-yellow banner? 
 Why did you have to ask what sort of a place this is?"*

*"Brazen ape!"* bellowed the Tang Monk. *"You're babbling! That banner is whipped by the wind. There might be words on it, but I can't see them clearly!"*

*"Of all persons,"* said Pilgrim, *"why is it that old Monkey's able to see them?"*

*"Master,"* both Eight Rules and Sha Monk said, *"don't listen to Elder Brother's jabberings! From this distance, we can hardly see the moated city clearly. Who could see any words?"*

*"Aren't those words, the Scarlet-Purple Kingdom?"* asked Pilgrim. Tripitaka said, *"The Scarlet-Purple Kingdom must be a state in the Western domain. That means we must have our rescript certified."*

*"That goes without saying,"* said Pilgrim.

In a little while, they arrived before the gate of the city, where Tripitaka dismounted. As they strolled through the triple-layered gates, they found that it was a marvelous national capital indeed. What they saw were

*Soaring towered gates,
Orderly parapets.
Around the city running water flowed freely;
North and south, it fronted on tall mountains.
Cargoes heaped up in its streets and markets;
Business flourished in every house and home.
Truly it was a meeting place of royalty,
A great capital, a Heavenly residence.
Towered boats came from distant shores.
Laden with foreign jades and gems.
Its noble form joined distant hills;
Its palaces reached the clear void.
Its three passes firmly secured,
Therein peace forever prospered.*

As master and disciples walked through the main boulevards, they found the looks of the people distinguished and imposing, their attire orderly and neat, and their language clear and resonant. Truly it was no different from the world of the Great Tang. Now, when those people on both sides busily engaged in buying and selling suddenly discovered the ugly visage of Eight Rules, the dark face and tall frame of Sha Monk, and the hairy features of Pilgrim Sun, they all abandoned their businesses and crowded around the pilgrims to stare at them.

Tripitaka felt compelled to call out, *"don't start any trouble! Lower your heads and walk on!"* Obeying his master, Eight Rules stuffed his lotus-rootlike mouth inside his bosom, and Sha Monk dared not raise his head. Only Pilgrim kept staring left and right as he walked closely beside the Tang Monk. After they had looked at the pilgrims for a while, those people who were more sensible went back to their own activities. The loiterers and the mischievous youths, however, all surged around Eight Rules; laughing and clamoring, they threw tiles and bricks at Eight Rules to tease him. The Tang Monk became so nervous that he was perspiring. All he could say was, *"don't start anything!"* Our Idiot dared not lift his head. In a moment, they turned the corner and came upon a large residence surrounded by an outer wall. On top of its entrance were the words, College of Interpreters.

*"Disciples,"* said the Tang Monk, *"let's go inside this official mansion."*

*"What for?"* asked Pilgrim.

*"The College of Interpreters,"* said the Tang Monk, *"is a meeting place for people from all parts of the world. Even we can make use of it. Let us go in and rest ourselves. After I have seen the throne and have had our rescript certified, we can then leave the city and be on our way once more."*

On hearing this, Eight Rules brought out his snout and frightened off several scores of those people following them. *"What Master says is quite right,"* he said as he walked forward. *"Let's hide inside so that we won't be bothered by the cacklings of these birdbrains!"*

They thus entered the college, and the people gradually dispersed. We tell you now that there were two officials inside the college, a minister proper and a vice-minister. They were both taking the roll in the great hall and preparing to meet other officials arriving. 

Startled by the sight of the Tang Monk walking in, they both said, *"Who are you? Who are you? Where do you think you are going?"*
Folding his hands before his chest, Tripitaka said, *"This humble cleric has been sent by the Throne of the Great Tang in the Land of the East to go seek scriptures in the Western Heaven. We came upon your treasure region, and we dared not pass through without permission. We would like to have our travel rescript certified, and we would like to ask for temporary lodging in your noble mansion."*

When those two college ministers heard what he said, they asked their attendants on both sides to step back. Fixing up their caps and tightening their belts, the ministers left the main hall to greet the Tang Monk. At once they asked that guest rooms be cleaned out for the pilgrims to rest, and they also ordered the preparation of vegetarian meals. After Tripitaka thanked them, the two officials departed with their staff, leaving only a few attendants to look after the priest.

As Tripitaka began to walk out, Pilgrim said spitefully, *"These rogues! Why didn't they allow old Monkey to stay in the main suite?"*

The Tang Monk said, *"Their territory here is not governed by our Great Tang, nor do we have any formal diplomatic relations. Moreover, the college is frequently visited by distinguished guests or high rank officials. That's probably why they find it difficult to entertain us here."*

*"If you put it that way,"* said Pilgrim, *"I would want them all the more to entertain us here."*

As they were speaking, a steward came in with some supplies: a large bowl of white rice, a large bowl of wheat flour, two bunches of green vegetables, four cakes of bean curd, two fried wheat gluten, one dish of dried bamboo shoots, and one dish of wood-ears.

Tripitaka told his disciples to accept these and thanked the steward. The steward said, *"In the west rooms there are clean pots and pans. The fires and stoves are ready. Please go there and cook the meal yourselves."*

*"Let me ask you this,"* said Tripitaka. *"Is the king still in the main hall?"*

*"His Majesty has not held court for a long time,"* replied the steward. *"Today happens to be an auspicious day, and at this very moment he is discussing with many civil and military officials the publication of a special proclamation. If you want to have your travel rescript certified, you should hurry there for you may still catch him. By tomorrow, you will not be able to have an audience with him, and I don't know how long you'll have to wait for another opportunity."*

*"Wukong,"* said Tripitaka, *"all of you stay here and prepare our meal. Let me hurry there to have our rescript certified. I'll then come back, eat, and we will leave."*

Quickly Eight Rules took out the cassock and the travel rescript: after Tripitaka put on the proper attire, he told his disciples not to leave the college and cause trouble outside before he went into court.

In a moment, he arrived before the Five Phoenix Tower, and we cannot begin to tell you how magnificent were those palatial halls and buildings. He went before the front gate proper and requested the imperial messenger to make known to the Heavenly Court his desire to have the rescript certified. The Custodian of the Yellow Gate indeed went before the white jade steps to memorialize:

*"Outside the gate of the court, there is a priest from the Great Tang in the Land of the East who, by imperial commission, is journeying to the Thunderclap Monastery in the Western Heaven to seek scriptures from Buddha. Desirous of having his travel rescript certified, he awaits our royal summons."*

On hearing this, the king said in delight, *"We have been ill for a long time and we have not ascended our throne. What a happy coincidence this is that the moment we appear in the main hall with the intent to find a good physician through the promulgation of a special proclamation, a noble priest immediately appears."*

He at once had the priest summoned to the hall, where Tripitaka prostrated himself to pay the king homage. The king then asked him to take a seat in the golden hall, after which the Court of Imperial Entertainments was asked to prepare a vegetarian banquet. Having thanked the king for his royal favors, Tripitaka presented the travel
rescript.

After he read the document, the king was very pleased. *"Master of the Law,"* he said, *"through how many successions of rulers and how many generations of ministers has your Great Tang passed? As for the Tang emperor, how did he return to life from his illness, so that he could ask you to traverse mountains and rivers to seek scriptures?"*

Faced with these questions, the elder bowed with hands folded to make his reply, saying, *"In the native land of your humble cleric,<br>
*Three August Ones ruled our world;
Five Thearchs set relations.
Yao and Shun defined kingship;
Yu and Tang gave the people peace.
But descendants of Cheng and Zhou
All desired independence.
Using might to oppress the weak,
They laid claim to sundry kingdoms.
They totaled eighteen rulers,
Dividing land and borders.
They decreased to twelve later,
And the world became tranquil.
For want of chariots and horses,
They again devoured each other.
Seven powers strove together,
And six states all bowed to Qin.
But Heaven gave birth to Pei of Lu,
Each envious of the other.
The empire then became Han‟s,
Which fixed laws for all to obey.
Then Han succumbed to Sima,
And Jin, too, became unruly.
North and South twelve states in all—
Such as Song, Qi, Liang, and Chen—
Lasted in close succession
Till Great Sui became the true heir.
Then came a lecher and despot
Who made the people suffer.
Our king with Li as his surname
Took Tang as his empire's title.
After emperor Gaozu departed,
Shimin became our present ruler.
Our rivers are clean, our seas tranquil,
For great is his kindness and virtue.
Now, north of the capital Chang‟an,
Lived a water sprite, a dragon god,
Who reduced some sweet rain
And thus deserved to perish.
Through a dream at night, however,
He begged our king for assistance.
The king promised him pardon,
And summoned a worthy subject,
Who was kept within the palace
To play chess slowly with the king.
When the time reached the noon hour,
That worthy subject slew the dragon in a dream."*

On hearing what Tripitaka said, the king suddenly groaned a few times and said, *"Master of the Law, from which country did that subject come?"*

*"He was the prime minister before the throne of our emperor,"* replied Tripitaka. *"His surname is Wei and his given name is Zheng. He knows astronomy and geography, and he can distinguish between yin and yang. He is truly a great minister and helper, one who knows how to secure the empire and establish the state. Because he executed the Dragon King of the Jing River in his dream, the dragon king filed suit in the region of darkness, accusing our emperor of reneging on his promise to spare his life. That was why our emperor became mortally ill. Then Wei Zheng wrote a letter for our emperor to take to the region of darkness and give to Cui Jue, a judge in the Capital of Death. When the Tang emperor indeed expired after a little while, he came back to life three days later all because of Wei Zheng, who moved Judge Cui to alter a document and add twenty more years to the emperor's age. Thereafter when the emperor gave a Grand Mass of Land and Water, he commissioned this humble cleric to traverse a great distance through many nations in order that I may seek from the Buddhist Patriarch the three baskets of Mahayāna scriptures, which will help redeem the cursed and wretched souls to Heaven."*

Groaning some more, the king sighed, *"Truly yours is a nation and a Heavenly Court! Your ruler is righteous, and your ministers are upright! Look at us! We have been ill for a long time, but not one minister is able to assist us."*

When he heard this, the elder stole a glance at the king and saw that his face looked yellow and his body seemed emaciated. His whole appearance, in fact, was weary and spiritless. The elder was about to question him further when the official from the Court of Imperial Entertainments approached to invite the Tang Monk to dine. The king at once gave this command: *"Set out our meal at the Hall of Unfurling Fragrance. We shall dine with the Master of the Law."* Tripitaka thanked him, and we shall leave them dining together.

We tell you now about Pilgrim in the College of Interpreters, who asked Sha Monk to make tea and rice and to prepare some vegetarian dishes. Sha Monk said, *"It's easy to make the tea and the rice, but it won't be easy to prepare the vegetarian dishes."*

*"Why?"* asked Pilgrim.

*"Oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar,"* replied Sha Monk, *"none of these can be found here."*

Pilgrim said, *"I have a few pennies of small change. Tell Eight Rules to go buy some on the streets."*

At once turning lazy, our Idiot said, *"I dare not go. My features aren't that nice looking, and I fear that Master will blame me if I cause any trouble."*

*"We are doing business fair and square!"* said Pilgrim. *"We aren't begging, and we aren't robbing. How could you cause any trouble?"*

*"Haven't you seen what I could do just now?"* said Eight Rules. *"I yanked out my snout before the door and scared off over ten persons. If I go to the bustling market, I don't know how many persons will be frightened to death."*

*"All you know is the bustling market,"* said Pilgrim, *"but have you seen what they are selling in this market?"*

*"Master told me to walk with my head bowed,"* replied Eight Rules, *"so as not to cause any trouble. In truth I haven't seen anything."*

Pilgrim said, *"There are wine shops, rice dealers, mills, and fabric stores, which we need not mention in detail. There are truly fine tea houses, noodle shops, huge biscuits, and gigantic buns. Moreover, the restaurants display nice soups and rice, fine spices, and excellent vegetables. I saw also exotic puddings, steamed goods, pastries, rolls, fried goods, and honey cakes—in fact, countless goodies. I'll go buy some of these to treat you. How's that?"*

When our Idiot heard this, saliva drooled from his mouth and his throat gurgled as he swallowed hard a few times. *"Elder Brother,"* he said, leaping up. *"I'll let you treat me this time. I'll save some money so that next time I can return your favor."*

Smiling to himself, Pilgrim said, *"Sha Monk, be careful in cooking the rice. We'll go and buy some seasoning."*

Knowing that he was making fun of Idiot, Sha Monk played along and replied, *"Go ahead, both of you. After you've fed yourself, bring back a lot of seasoning."*

Picking up a container, our Idiot followed Pilgrim out the door. Two officials asked, *"Where are the elders going?"*

*"To buy seasoning,"* replied Pilgrim. *"Go west on this street,"* said one of them, *"and make a turn at the corner watchtower. You'll find the Zheng family grocery, where you can buy however much you like. Oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, ginger, pepper, and tea—they have them all."*

The two of them, arm in arm, followed the street to the west. Pilgrim walked right past several teahouses and restaurants, refusing to buy what ought to be bought, to eat what ought to be eaten.

*"Elder Brother,"* Eight Rules called out, *"let's not be so choosy. Just buy something here and we'll enjoy it."* Pilgrim, who had wanted to sport with him, refused, of course, to buy anything. *"Worthy Brother,"* he said, *"don't be such a spendthrift! Let's walk a bit further, and we'll buy something big to eat."*

As the two of them chatted, they again caused many people to follow them, staring. In a little while, they reached the watchtower, beneath which they found a large, noisy crowd blocking the street. On seeing them, Eight Rules said, *"Elder Brother, I'm not going over there. Look at the mob. I fear that they may want to arrest monks, especially those who are strangers. If they seize me, what'll happen to me?"*

*"Nonsense!"* said Pilgrim. *"Monks haven't broken the law. Why should they want to arrest us? Let's walk past them so that we can buy some seasoning from the Zheng family store."*

*"All right! All right! All right!"* said Eight Rules. *"I won't cause any trouble. I'll just squeeze into the crowd, flap my ears a couple of times, and frighten them into falling down. Let a few of them fall to their deaths, and I'll just pay with my life!"*

*"If you put it that way,"* said Pilgrim, *"why don't you stand still here at the base of the wall. Let me go to the store and get the seasoning. Then I'll buy some vegetarian noodles and biscuits for you to eat."*

Handing the container over to Pilgrim, our Idiot faced the wall, stuck his snout against it, and stood absolutely still. Pilgrim walked up to the tower, and it was crowded indeed. As he pushed his way through the throng, he learned that a special royal proclamation had been mounted beneath the tower, and that was why so many people fought to look at it. When he finally squeezed through to where the document was, Pilgrim opened wide his fiery
eyes and diamond pupils to stare at it, and this was what he read:

Since we, the king of the Scarlet-Purple Kingdom in the West Aparagodānīya Continent, assumed our throne, the four quarters have remained submissive and the populace have enjoyed leisure and peace. Recently, however, the affairs of state have turned inauspicious, for we have been gravely ill, and recovery has been most difficult even after a long time. The college of imperial medicine of our nation has administered repeatedly its excellent prescriptions, but these have not given us cure. Therefore, we publish now this proclamation for all the worthy scholars throughout the world, regardless of whether they are going to the North, coming from the East, or are even natives of China, the foreign state. If there is anyone skillful in medicine and the therapeutic arts, let him ascend the treasure hall and restore our health. We most solemnly pledge that the moment we are healed, we will divide the kingdom with him. For this reason we have mounted this necessary proclamation.

When he finished reading it, Pilgrim was filled with delight, saying to himself, *"The ancients said, Moving about may bring us riches!"* We certainly shouldn't have sat idly in the college, nor is there any need now to buy seasoning. Let's delay for one day this business of fetching scriptures and allow old Monkey to play physician for a bit."*

Dear Great Sage! He stooped low and left the container on the ground; picking up a pinch of dirt, he flung it up into the air and recited a spell. Immediately, the Magic of Body-Concealment rendered him invisible, so that he could walk up to the proclamation and gently peel it off. Then he faced the ground toward the southwest and sucked in a deep breath before blowing the air out again. At once a strong whirlwind arose and scattered the multitude. He turned around and went back to where Eight Rules was standing. There he found Eight Rules leaning on the base of the wall with the support of his snout and appearing as if he had fallen asleep. Without disturbing him, Pilgrim folded up the proclamation and gently stuck it in Eight Rules's bosom. In big strides he then went back first to the College of Interpreters, where we shall leave him. We tell you now instead about those people beneath the watchtower. When the wind arose, all of them covered their heads and shut their eyes. Little did they anticipate that after the wind had passed, the royal proclamation would be nowhere to be seen, and
each one of them was terrified. Originally, you see, the proclamation was accompanied by twelve eunuchs and twelve palace guards as it left the court that morning. It had not been hung up for more than three hours when it was blown away by the wind. Trembling all over, those eunuchs and guards searched for it left and right, and that was when they suddenly caught sight of a slip of paper sticking out from the bosom of Zhu Eight Rules. *"Did you peel off the proclamation?"* shouted the officials as they ran up to him.

All at once that Idiot raised his head and stuck out his snout, so frightening those several palace guards that they stumbled backwards and fell down. He turned around and wanted to flee, but he was pulled back by several of the braver ones.

*"You took down the royal proclamation for the recruitment of physicians,"* they cried. *"Where do you think you are going if you aren't going into court to heal His Majesty?"*

More and more flustered, our Idiot said, *"Your son is the one who peeled off the royal proclamation! Your grandson is the one who knows anything about healing!"*

One of the palace guards spoke up: *"What's that you have in your bosom?"*

Only then did Idiot lower his head and find that there was indeed a piece of paper there. When he spread it open and took one look, he clenched his teeth and cried, *"That wretched ape has killed me!"*

He became so furious that he would have ripped up the document if the people had not stopped him. *"You are dead!"* they shouted. *"This is a proclamation of our reigning monarch. Who dares to tear it up? If you have taken it down and stuffed it into your bosom, you
must be a physician able to heal him. Go with us, quickly!"*

*"You have no idea,"* shouted Eight Rules, *"that I did not take down this proclamation. It was taken down by my elder brother, Sun Wukong. After he stuck it secretly in my bosom, he abandoned me and left. If you want to get to the bottom of this matter, I have to go find him for you."*

*"What sort of wild talk is that?"* said the people. *"You think We'd forsake a ready-made bell to strike one about to be forged? You took down the proclamation! And you tell us now to find someone else! Never mind you! We'll haul you back to see our lord!"*

Without further investigation of the matter, that group of people began to push and shove Idiot. Our Idiot, however, stood perfectly still, and he seemed to have taken root in the earth. Not even a dozen people could budge him.

*"All of you don't know any better!"* said Eight Rules. *"If you pull at me some more, you will pull out my idiotic ire! don't blame me then!"* Soon the entire neighborhood was aroused by all that hubbub to come and have Eight Rules surrounded. Among the people were two elderly eunuchs, who said to him, *"Your looks are strange and your voice sounds unfamiliar. Where have you come from, and why are you so headstrong?"*

*"We are those from the Land of the East sent to seek scriptures in the Western Heaven,"* replied Eight Rules. *"My master is a Master of the Law and the bond-brother of the Tang emperor. Just now he has gone into court to have his travel rescript certified. My elder brother and I came here to buy seasoning. When I saw the crowd beneath the watchtower, I dared not go forward, and my elder brother told me to wait for him here. When he saw the proclamation, he called up a whirlwind and had it taken off and stuck secretly in my bosom. Then he left me."*

*"Just now,"* said one of the eunuchs, *"I saw a stoutish priest with a white face heading straight for the gate of the court. He, I suppose, must be your master."*

*"He is indeed,"* said Eight Rules.

*"Where has your elder brother gone to?"* asked the eunuch. Eight Rules said, *"There are altogether four of us. Our master has gone to have our travel rescript certified, but the rest of us—three disciples, a horse, and our luggage are all resting at the College of Interpreters. After my elder brother had played this trick on me, he must have returned to the college."*

*"Palace guards,"* said the eunuch, *"stop tugging at this man. Let us go with him to the college, and we'll know the whole truth of the matter."*

*"These two mamas are far more sensible!"* said Eight Rules.

*"This priest is truly uninformed!"* said one of the palace guards. *"How could you address the papas as mamas?"*

*"Aren't you ashamed of yourself?"* said Eight Rules, laughing. *"You are the one who's switching the sexes! These two old mamas should be addressed as popos or madams. And you want to call them papas?"*

*"Stop your saucy tongue!"* the people said. *"Go find your elder brother quickly."*

By that time the noisy crowd had grown to over five hundred people, all surging up to the entrance of the college. *"Stop here, all of you,"* said Eight Rules. *"My elder brother is not like me, who allows you this spoofing. He is rather hot-tempered, and terribly serious. When you meet him, you must extend to him a grand salutation and address him as Venerable Father Sun. Then he'll do business with you. Otherwise, he may change his colors and you won't succeed with your enterprise."*


*"If your elder brother truly has the ability to heal our king,"* said the eunuchs and the palace guards, *"he will inherit half the kingdom. He certainly deserves our bow."*

While the idlers milled about noisily before the college, Eight Rules led the troop of eunuchs and palace guards inside, where they heard Pilgrim laughing and telling Sha Monk the trick he had played on Eight Rules. Eight Rules dashed forward and grabbed him, screaming, *"Some person you are! You tricked me out there and promised to buy vegetarian noodles, biscuits, and buns for me to eat.
They're all fibs! Then you brought on the whirlwind and took down this socalled royal proclamation to have it stuck secretly in my bosom. You are playing me for a fatso! Is that how you treat your brother?"*

Laughing, Pilgrim said, *"Idiot, you must have taken the wrong road and gone off to someplace else! I passed the watchtower, bought the seasoning, and came back quickly to where you were, but I couldn't find you. So, I returned here first. Where did I peel off any royal proclamation?"*

*"The officials guarding the proclamation are right here,"* said Eight Rules. Hardly had he finished speaking when those several eunuchs and palace guards went forward to bow deeply to Pilgrim. *"Venerable Father Sun,"* they said, *"today our king
must be exceedingly fortunate, for Heaven has sent you to descend to us. We beseech you to exercise your great talents in healing and your profound knowledge in the therapeutic arts. If you succeed in curing our king, you will have claim to half the kingdom."*

On hearing these words, Pilgrim became more sober. He took the proclamation and asked the people, *"Are you the officials guarding the proclamation?"*

Kowtowing, the eunuchs said, *"Your slaves are palace officials belonging to the Directorate of Ceremonials. These are the Embroidered-Uniform Guards."*

*"This proclamation for recruitment of physicians,"* said Pilgrim, *"was indeed taken down by me. I purposely arranged for my brother to lead you to see me. Your lord is indisposed, but as the proverb says,<br>
Medicines are not lightly bought;
A doctor's not casually sought.<br>
You go back and ask the king to come here in person to invite me. I guarantee that when I stretch forth my hand, his illness will at once disappear."*

When they heard these words, all of the eunuchs were astonished. *"A stupendous claim like this can be made only by someone in the know,"* said one of the palace guards. *"Half of us will remain here to continue our silent entreaty. Half of us will return to memorialize to the throne."*

Whereupon four eunuchs and six palace guards, without waiting for any summons, went inside the court and memorialized before the steps, saying, *"My lord, ten thousand happinesses have come upon you!"*

Having finished his meal, the king was just having a quiet chat with Tripitaka. When he heard this, he asked, *"Where has this happiness come from?"*

One of the eunuchs said, *"This morning your slaves took the royal proclamation for the recruitment of physicians to have it mounted beneath the watchtower. It was taken down by Elder Sun, a sage monk sent from the distant Land of the East to acquire scriptures. He is now residing in the College of Interpreters and desires the personal appearance of the king to invite him. He has promised us that when he stretches forth his hand, the illness will disappear. That is why we have come to memorialize to you."*

On hearing this, the king was filled with delight. He turned to ask the Tang Monk, *"Master of the Law, how many noble disciples do you have?"*

*"This humble cleric,"* replied Tripitaka with hands folded before him, *"has three mischievous disciples."*

*"Which of them is conversant with the therapeutic arts?"* asked the king.

*To tell you the truth, Your Majesty,"* said Tripitaka, *"my mischievous disciples are all ordinary men of the wilds. Their knowledge is confined to pulling the horse and toting the luggage, to fording streams and leading your poor monk across the mountains. When we pass through the more dangerous regions, they may even be able to subjugate demons and fiends, to tame tigers and dragons. But that's all! None of them knows anything about the nature of medicine."*

*"Why must you be so modest, Master of the Law?"* said the king. *"It is truly a Heavenly affinity that you should arrive on this very day when we ascend the main hall. If your noble disciple were not an able physician, how would he be willing to take down our proclamation and demand our going there in person to invite him? He must have the ability to heal the highest ruler of the state."*

Then the king gave this order:
*"Let our civil and military subjects represent us, for our body is weakened and our strength depleted, and we dare not ride the imperial chariot. You must therefore proceed beyond the court to extend our most earnest invitation to Elder Sun to come and
examine our illness. When you see him, you must be careful not to treat him discourteously. You must address him as Elder Sun, the divine monk, and you must greet him as if he were your ruler."*

Having received this decree, the various officials went with the eunuchs and the palace guards to the College of Interpreters. Standing in rows according to their ranks, they paid homage to Pilgrim. Eight Rules was so taken aback that he dashed inside a side room while Sha Monk ran out to stand beneath the wall. Look at our Great Sage! He sat firmly in the middle of the room and remained unmoved. 

*"This wretched ape,"* grumbled Eight Rules to himself, *"is hanging himself alive with all these undeserved honors! How could he not return the bow of these many officials? Why, he won't even stand up!"*

Soon the ceremony was over, and the officials separated into two files before they presented this memorial, saying, *"Let us inform Elder Sun, the divine monk, that we are the subjects of the king of the Scarlet-Purple Kingdom. By royal decree, we come to honor the divine monk with due reverence and ceremony. We beseech you to enter the court and examine a patient."* Only then did Pilgrim stand up and say to them, *"Why didn't your king come here?"*
*"Because his body is weakened and his strength depleted,"* replied the officials, our king dares not ride the chariot. He has commanded us subjects to observe this ceremony on his behalf and invite you, the divine monk."*

*"In that case,"* said Pilgrim, *"please lead the way, all of you, and I'll follow."*

The various officials departed in groups, in accordance with their ranks, while Pilgrim walked behind them after having tidied his clothes. *"Elder Brother,"* said Eight Rules, *"don't you put us up to anything now!"*

*"I won't,"* said Pilgrim, *"but I want you two to accept the medicines for me."*

*"What medicines?"* asked Sha Monk. *"There will be some medicines sent to us,"* said Pilgrim. *"Accept them in the quantities that they are delivered. I'll make use of them when I return."*

The two of them agreed, and we shall leave them for the moment. Our Pilgrim soon arrived at court with the many officials, who walked ahead to report to the king. As the pearly screen was rolled up, the king opened his phoenix eyes and dragon pupils to look at his visitor and his golden mouth to say, *"Who is the divine monk, Elder Sun?"*

Taking a big step forward, Pilgrim said in a loud voice, *"Old Monkey's the one!"* When the king heard this savage voice and encountered the bizarre countenance, he shook so violently that he fell back onto the dragon couch. Those harem girls and palace attendants hurriedly had him borne inside the palace, and all the king could say was, *"We are scared to death!"*

All the officials began to chide Pilgrim, saying, *"How could this monk be so rude and impetuous? How could you be so audacious as to take down the proclamation?"*

Hearing these words, Pilgrim smiled and said, *"All of you have wrongly taken umbrage at me! If that's how you treat people, the illness of your king won't be cured for another thousand years!"*

*"How long can a man live,"* asked the officials, *"that he should be ill for a thousand years?"* Pilgrim said, *"That man at the moment is a sick ruler. After he dies, he'll be a sick ghost. Even in the next incarnation, he will still be a sick man. Isn't it true
then that he won't be cured for a thousand years?"*

Growing angry, the officials said, *"Monk, you have absolutely no manners! How dare you mouth such nonsense?"*

*"That's no nonsense!"* replied Pilgrim with a laugh. *"Listen to what I have to say:<br>
Most mysterious is the physician's art;
His mind must ever be alert and keen.
To look, listen, ask, and take—these four things—
If one is missing, his craft's not complete.
One, we look at the patient's complexion:
Is it moist, dry, fat, or thin in waking or sleep?
Two, we listen for clear or turbid voice
When he speaks lucid or frenetic words.
Three, we ask for the ailment's cause and length.
For how he eats, drinks, and eliminates.
Four, we scan the conduits by taking the pulse,
To learn how submerged or floating in and out.
If we do not look, listen, ask, and take,
In this life his ailment will ne‟er him forsake!"*

Amid those two rows of military and civil officials standing in attendance, there was the royal physician who, when he heard these words, spoke up with great approbation.

*"What this monk says,"* he said, *"is most reasonable. Even an immortal examining a patient must look, listen, ask, and take—these very activities accord well with the efficacy of gods and sages."*

Persuaded by this statement, the officials asked a palace attendant to send in the message: *"The elder would like to exercise the principles of looking, listening, asking, and taking, before he could diagnose the illness and prescribe the medicine."*

Lying on his dragon bed, the king gasped out his answer: *"Tell him to go away! We can't bear to see an unfamiliar face!"*

The attendant walked out of the palace and said, *"Monk, our king decrees you to leave, for he can't bear to see an unfamiliar face."*

*"If he can't do so,"* replied Pilgrim, *"I know that art of Dangling a Thread to take the Pulse."*

The various officials were secretly pleased, saying to themselves, *"We have heard of this rare technique, but we have never seen it."*

They said to the attendant, *"Go and memorialize once more."* Again the attendant went inside the palace to say, *"My lord, if that elder is not permitted to see your face, he can dangle a thread to take the pulse."*

The king thought to himself, *"We have been sick for three years but we've never tried this."*

He therefore gave the reply, *"Summon him in."*

Immediately the attendant transmitted the message: *"Our lord has given him the permission to take the pulse by dangling a thread. Summon Elder Sun quickly into the palace."*

Pilgrim at once started to ascend the treasure hall, only to be met by the scolding of Tang Monk. *"Wretched ape!"* he cried.

*"You've injured me!"* Smiling, Pilgrim said, *"Dear Master, I have put you in the limelight! How could you say that I've injured you?"*

*"Which person did you manage to cure,"* shouted Tripitaka, *"during these few years you've been following me? You don't even know the nature of medicines, nor have you read any medical texts. How could you be so audacious as to rush into this big calamity?"*

Laughing, Pilgrim said, *"Master, you didn't know about this. I know a few herbal prescriptions which can cure even grave illnesses. All they care is that I heal him. But even if I kill him, all I'll be guilty of is merely manslaughter because of medical incompetence. I won't be executed. Why are you so worried? Relax! Relax! Take a seat and see if I'm any good at taking the pulse."*

The elder again said, *"Have you ever seen what sort of sentences there are in the Candid Questions, The Classic of Medical Problems, the pharmacopoeias, and the Formulas of the Pulse? Do you know their proper gloss and exegesis? How could you babble like this about some dangling the thread to take the pulse?"*

Laughing, Pilgrim said, *"I carry with me some threads of gold which you have never seen."*

He reached back with his hand and pulled off three strands of hair from his tail. Giving them a pinch, he cried, *"Change!"*

They changed at once into three threads, each twenty-four feet long and thus corresponding to the Twenty-Four Solar Terms. Holding them in his hands, he said to the Tang Monk, *"Aren't these my golden threads?"*

The attending eunuch spoke up from the side, *"Let the elders refrain from further conversation. Please enter the palace to examine the patient."*

Taking leave of the Tang Monk, Pilgrim followed the attendant to walk inside the palace. Truly it was that The mind's secret prescription can heal a state; Its wondrous formula will assure long life. After he had gone inside, we do not know what sort of illness he was able to discern or what kind of medicines he prescribed. If you want to know the result, let's listen to the explanation in the next chapter.
