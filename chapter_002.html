        <p>
            Now we were speaking of the Handsome Monkey King, who, having received
            his name, jumped about joyfully and went forward to give Subodhi his grateful
            salutation. The Patriarch then ordered the congregation to lead Sun Wukong outdoors
            and to teach him how to sprinkle water on the ground and dust, and how to speak and
            move with proper courtesy. The company of immortals obediently went outside with
            Wukong, who then bowed to his fellow students. They prepared thereafter a place in the
            corridor where he might sleep. Next morning he began to learn from his schoolmates
            the arts of language and etiquette. He discussed with them the scriptures and the
            doctrines; he practiced calligraphy and burned incense. Such was his daily routine. In
            more leisurely moments he would be sweeping the grounds or hoeing the garden,
            planting flowers or pruning trees, gathering firewood or lighting fires, fetching water or
            carrying drinks. He did not lack for whatever he needed, and thus he lived in the cave
            without realizing that six or seven years had slipped by. One day the Patriarch ascended
            the platform and took his high seat. Calling together all the immortals, he began to
            lecture on a great doctrine. He spoke
        </p>
        <blockquote><em>
                With words so florid and eloquent<br>
                That gold lotus sprang up from the ground.<br>
                The doctrine of three vehicles he subtly rehearsed,<br>
                Including even the laws' minutest tittle.<br>
                The yak's-tail waved slowly and spouted elegance:<br>
                His thunderous voice moved e'en the Ninth Heaven.<br>
                For a while he lectured on Dao;<br>
                For a while he spoke on Chan—<br>
                To harmonize the Three Parties is a natural thing.<br>
                One word's elucidation filled with truth<br>
                Points to the birthless showing nature's mystery.</em></blockquote>
        <p>
            Wukong, who was standing there and listening, was so pleased with the talk that
            he scratched his ear and rubbed his jaw. Grinning from ear to ear, he could not refrain
            from dancing on all fours! Suddenly the Patriarch saw this and called out to him, <em>"Why
                are you madly jumping and dancing in the ranks and not listening to my lecture?"</em>
            Wukong said, <em>"Your pupil was devoutly listening to the lecture. But when I heard such
                wonderful things from my reverend master, I couldn't contain myself for joy and started
                to leap and prance about quite unconsciously. May the master forgive my sins!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Let me ask you,"</em> said the Patriarch, <em>"if you comprehend these wonderful
                things, do you know how long you have been in this cave?"</em> Wukong said, <em>"Your pupil
                is basically feeble-minded and does not know the number of seasons. I only remember
                that whenever the fire burned out in the stove, I would go to the back of the mountain to
                gather firewood. Finding a mountainful of fine peach trees there, I have eaten my fill of
                peaches seven times."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Patriarch said, <em>"That mountain is named the Ripe Peach Mountain. If you
                have eaten your fill seven times, I suppose it must have been seven years. What kind of
                Daoist art would you like to learn from me?"</em> Wukong said, <em>"I am dependent on the
                admonition of my honored teacher. Your pupil would gladly learn whatever has a
                smidgen of Daoist flavor."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Patriarch said, <em>"Within the tradition of Dao, there are three hundred and
                sixty heteronomous divisions, all the practices of which may result in Illumination. I
                don't know which division you would like to follow."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"I am dependent on the will of my honored teacher,"</em> said Wukong. <em>"Your pupil
                is wholeheartedly obedient."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"How would it be,"</em> said the Patriarch, <em>"if I taught you the practice of the
                Method division?"</em> Wukong asked, <em>"How would you explain the practice of the Method
                division?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"The practice of the Method division,"</em> said the Patriarch, <em>"consists of
                summoning immortals and working the planchette, of divination by manipulating
                yarrow stalks, and of learning the secrets of pursuing good and avoiding evil."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Can this sort of practice lead to immortality?"</em> asked Wukong.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Impossible! Impossible!"</em> said the Patriarch. <em>"I won't learn it then,"</em> Wukong
            said.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"How would it be,"</em> said the Patriarch again, <em>"if I taught you the practice of the
                Schools division?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"What is the meaning of the Schools division?"</em> asked Wukong. <em>"The Schools
                division,"</em> the Patriarch said, <em>"includes the Confucians, the Buddhists, the Daoists, the
                Dualists, the Mohists, and the Physicians. They read scriptures or recite prayers; they
                interview priests or conjure up saints and the like."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Can this sort of practice lead to immortality?"</em> asked Wukong. The Patriarch
            said, <em>"If immortality is what you desire, this practice is like setting a pillar inside a
                wall."</em> Wukong said, <em>"Master, I'm a simple fellow and I don't know the idioms of the
                marketplace. What's setting a pillar inside a wall?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Patriarch said, <em>"When people build houses and want them to be sturdy, they
                place a pillar as a prop inside the wall. But someday the big mansion will decay, and the
                pillar too will rot."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"What you're saying then,"</em> Wukong said, <em>"is that it is not long-lasting. I'm not
                going to learn this."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Patriarch said, <em>"How would it be if I taught you the practice of the Silence
                division?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"What's the aim of the Silence division?"</em> Wukong asked. <em>"To cultivate fasting
                and abstinence,"</em> said the Patriarch, <em>"quiescence and inactivity, meditation and the art of
                crosslegged sitting, restraint of language, and a vegetarian diet. There are also the
                practices of yoga, exercises standing or prostrate, entrance into complete stillness,
                contemplation in solitary confinement, and the like."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Can these activities,"</em> asked Wukong, <em>"bring about immortality?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"They are no better than the unfired bricks on the kiln,"</em> said the Patriarch.
            Wukong laughed and said, <em>"Master indeed loves to beat about the bush! Haven't I just
                told you that I don't know these idioms of the marketplace? What do you mean by the
                unfired bricks on the kiln?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Patriarch replied, <em>"The tiles and the bricks on the kiln may have been
                molded into shape, but if they have not been refined by water and fire, a heavy rain will
                one day make them crumble."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"So this too lacks permanence,"</em> said Wukong.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"I don't want to learn it."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Patriarch said, <em>"How would it be if I taught you the practice of the Action
                division?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"What's it like in the Action division?"</em> Wukong asked. <em>"Plenty of activities,"</em>
            said the Patriarch, <em>"such as gathering the yin to nourish the yang, bending the bow and
                treading the arrow, and rubbing the navel to pass breath. There are also experimentation
                with alchemical formulas, burning rushes and forging cauldrons, taking red lead,
                making autumn stone, and drinking bride's milk and the like."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Can such bring about long life?"</em> asked Wukong. <em>"To obtain immortality from
                such activities,"</em> said the Patriarch, <em>"is also like scooping the moon from the water."</em>
            <em>"There you go again, Master!"</em> cried Wukong. <em>"What do you mean by scooping
                the moon from the water?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Patriarch said, <em>"When the moon is high in the sky, its reflection is in the
                water. Although it is visible therein, you cannot scoop it out or catch hold of it, for it is
                but an illusion."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"I won't learn that either!"</em> said Wukong.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the Patriarch heard this, he uttered a cry and jumped down from the high
            platform. He pointed the ruler he held in his hands at Wukong and said to him:
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"What a mischievous monkey you are! You won't learn this and you won't learn
                that! Just what is it that you are waiting for?"</em> Moving forward, he hit Wukong three
            times on the head. Then he folded his arms behind his back and walked inside, closing
            the main doors behind him and leaving the congregation stranded outside. Those who
            were listening to the lecture were so terrified that everyone began to berate Wukong.
            <em>"You reckless ape!"</em> they cried, <em>"you're utterly without manners! The master was
                prepared to teach you magic secrets. Why weren't you willing to learn? Why did you
                have to argue with him instead? Now you have offended him, and who knows when
                he'll come out again?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            At that moment they all resented him and despised and ridiculed him. But
            Wukong was not angered in the least and only replied with a broad grin. For the
            Monkey King, in fact, had already solved secretly, as it were, the riddle in the pot; he
            therefore did not quarrel with the other people but patiently held his tongue. He
            reasoned that the master, by hitting him three times, was telling him to prepare himself
            for the third watch; and by folding his arms behind his back, walking inside, and closing
            the main doors, was telling him to enter by the back door so that he might receive
            instruction in secret.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wukong spent the rest of the day happily with the other pupils in front of the
            Divine Cave of the Three Stars, eagerly waiting for the night. When evening arrived, he
            immediately retired with all the others, pretending to be asleep by closing his eyes,
            breathing evenly, and remaining completely still. Since there was no watchman in the
            mountain to beat the watch or call the hour, he could not tell what time it was. He could
            only rely on his own calculations by counting the breaths he inhaled and exhaled. Approximately at the hour
            of Zi, he arose very quietly and put on his clothes. Stealthily
            opening the front door, he slipped away from the crowd and walked outside.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lifting his head, he saw
        </p>
        <blockquote><em>
                The bright moon and the cool, clear dew,<br>
                Though in each corner not one speck of dust.<br>
                Sheltered fowls roosted in the woods;<br>
                A brook flowed gently from its source.<br>
                Darting fireflies dispersed the gloom.<br>
                Wild geese spread word columns through the clouds.<br>
                Precisely it was the third-watch hour—<br>
                Time to seek the Way whole and true.</em></blockquote>
        <p>
            You see him following the familiar path back to the rear entrance, where he
            discovered that the door was, indeed, ajar. Wukong said happily, <em>"The reverend master
                truly intended to give me instruction. That's why the door was left open."</em>
            He reached the door in a few large strides and entered sideways. Walking up to
            the Patriarch's bed, he found him asleep with his body curled up, facing the wall.
            Wukong dared not disturb him; instead, he knelt before his bed. After a little
            while, the Patriarch awoke. Stretching his legs, he recited to himself:
        </p>
        <blockquote><em>
                "Hard! Hard! Hard!<br>
                The Way is most obscure!<br>
                Deem not the gold elixir a common thing.<br>
                Without a perfect man's transmiting a subtle rune,<br>
                You'd have vain words, worn mouth, and tongue waxed dry!"</em></blockquote>
        <p>
            <em>"Master,"</em> Wukong responded at once. <em>"Your pupil has been kneeling here and
                waiting on you for a long time."</em> When the Patriarch heard Wukong's voice, he rose and
            put on his clothes. <em>"You mischievous monkey!"</em> he exclaimed, sitting down crosslegged, <em>"Why
                aren't you
                sleeping in front? What are you doing back here at my place?"</em>
            Wukong replied, <em>"Before the platform and the congregation yesterday, the master gave
                the order that your pupil, at the hour of the third watch, should come here through the
                rear entrance in order that he might be instructed. I was therefore bold enough to come
                directly to the master's bed."</em> When the Patriarch heard this, he was terribly pleased,
            thinking to himself, <em>"This fellow is indeed an offspring of Heaven and Earth.
                If not, how could he solve so readily the riddle in my pot!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"There is no third party here save your pupil,"</em> Wukong said. <em>"May the master be
                exceedingly merciful and impart to me the way of long life. I shall never forget this
                gracious favor."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Since you have solved the riddle in the pot,"</em> said the Patriarch, <em>"it is an
                indication that you are destined to learn, and I am glad to teach you. Come closer and
                listen carefully. I will impart to you the wondrous way of long life."</em> Wukong kowtowed
            to express his gratitude, washed his ears, and listened most attentively, kneeling before
            the bed. The Patriarch said:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <em>"This bold, secret saying that's wondrous and true:<br>
                Spare, nurse nature and life—there's nothing else.<br>
                All power resides in the semen, breath, and spirit;<br>
                Store these securely lest there be a leak.<br>
                Lest there be a leak!<br>
                Keep within the body!<br>
                Heed my teaching and the Way itself will thrive.<br>
                Hold fast oral formulas so useful and keen<br>
                To purge concupiscence, to reach pure cool;<br>
                To pure cool<br>
                Where the light is bright.<br>
                You'll face the elixir platform, enjoying the moon.<br>
                The moon holds the jade rabbit, the sun, the crow;<br>
                The tortoise and snake are now tightly entwined.<br>
                Tightly entwined,<br>
                Nature and life are strong.<br>
                You can plant gold lotus e'en in the midst of flames.<br>
                Squeeze the Five Phases jointly, use them back and forth—<br>
                When that's done, be a Buddha or immortal at will!"</em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            At that moment, the very origin was disclosed to Wukong, whose mind became
            spiritualized as blessedness came to him. He carefully committed to memory all the oral
            formulas. After kowtowing to thank the Patriarch, he left by the rear entrance. As he
            went out, he saw that</p>
        <blockquote><em>
                The eastern sky began to pale with light,<br>
                But golden beams shone on the Westward Way.</em></blockquote>
        <p>
            Following the same path, he returned to the front door, pushed it open quietly,
            and went inside. He sat up in his sleeping place and purposely rustled the bed and the
            covers, crying, <em>"It's light! It's light! Get up!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            All the other people were still sleeping and did not know that Wukong had
            received a good thing. He played the fool that day after getting up, but he persisted in
            what he had learned secretly by doing breathing exercises before the hour of Zi and
            after the hour of Wu.
        </p>
        <p>
            Three years went by swiftly, and the Patriarch again mounted his throne to
            lecture to the multitude. He discussed the scholastic deliberations and parables, and he
            discoursed on the integument of external conduct. Suddenly he asked, <em>"Where's
                Wukong?"</em> Wukong drew near and knelt down. <em>"Your pupil's here,"</em> he said. <em>"What sort
                of art have you been practicing lately?"</em> the Patriarch asked.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Recently,"</em> Wukong said, <em>"your pupil has begun to apprehend the nature of all
                things and my foundational knowledge has become firmly established."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"If you have penetrated to the dharma nature to apprehend the origin,"</em> said the
            Patriarch, <em>"you have, in fact, entered into the divine substance. You need, however, to
                guard against the danger of three calamities."</em> When Wukong heard this, he thought for
            a long time and said, <em>"The words of the master must be erroneous. I have frequently
                heard that when one is learned in the Way and excels in virtue, he will enjoy the same
                age as Heaven; fire and water cannot harm him and every kind of disease will vanish.
                How can there be this danger of three calamities?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"What you have learned,"</em> said the Patriarch, <em>"is no ordinary magic: you have
                stolen the creative powers of Heaven and Earth and invaded the dark mysteries of the
                sun and moon. Your success in perfecting the elixir is something that the gods and the
                demons cannot countenance. Though your appearance will be preserved and your age
                lengthened, after five hundred years Heaven will send down the calamity of thunder to
                strike you. Hence you must be intelligent and wise enough to avoid it ahead of time. If
                you can escape it, your age will indeed equal that of Heaven; if not, your life will thus
                be finished. After another five hundred years Heaven will send down the calamity of
                fire to burn you. That fire is neither natural nor common fire; its name is the Fire of Yin,
                and it arises from within the soles of your feet to reach even the cavity of your heart,
                reducing your entrails to ashes and your limbs to utter ruin. The arduous labor of a
                millennium will then have been made completely superfluous. After another five
                hundred years the calamity of wind will be sent to blow at you. It is not the wind from
                the north, south, east, or west; nor is it one of the winds of four seasons; nor is it the
                wind of flowers, willows, pines, and bamboos. It is called the Mighty Wind, and it
                enters from the top of the skull into the body, passes through the midriff, and penetrates
                the nine apertures.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bones and the flesh will be dissolved and the body itself will disintegrate.
            You must therefore avoid all three calamities."</em> When Wukong heard this, his hairs
            stood on end, and, kowtowing reverently, he said, <em>"I beg the master to be merciful and
                impart to me the method to avoid the three calamities. To the very end, I shall never
                forget your gracious favor."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Patriarch said, <em>"It is not, in fact, difficult, except that I cannot teach you
                because you are somewhat different from other people."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"I have a round head pointing to Heaven,"</em> said Wukong, <em>"and square feet
                walking on Earth. Similarly, I have nine apertures and four limbs, entrails and cavities.
                In what way am I different from other people?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Patriarch said, <em>"Though you resemble a man, you have much less jowl."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The monkey, you see, has an angular face with hollow cheeks and a pointed
            mouth. Stretching his hand to feel himself, Wukong laughed and said, <em>"The master does
                not know how to balance matters! Though I have much less jowl than human beings, I
                have my pouch, which may certainly be considered a compensation."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Very well, then,"</em> said the Patriarch, <em>"what method of escape would you like to
                learn? There is the Art of the Heavenly Ladle, which numbers thirty-six
                transformations, and there is the Art of the Earthly Multitude, which numbers seventytwo
                transformations."</em>
            Wukong said, <em>"Your pupil is always eager to catch more fishes,
                so I'll learn the Art of the Earthly Multitude."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"In that case,"</em> said the Patriarch, <em>"come up here, and I'll pass on the oral
                formulas to you."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            He then whispered something into his ear, though we do not know what sort of
            wondrous secrets he spoke of. But this Monkey King was someone who, knowing one
            thing, could understand a hundred! He immediately learned the oral formulas and, after
            working at them and practicing them himself, he mastered all seventy-two
            transformations.
        </p>
        <p>
            One day when the Patriarch and the various pupils were admiring the evening
            view in front of the Three Stars Cave, the master asked, <em>"Wukong, has that matter been
                perfected?"</em> Wukong said, <em>"Thanks to the profound kindness of the master, your pupil
                has indeed attained perfection; I now can ascend like mist into the air and fly."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Patriarch said, <em>"Let me see you try to fly."</em> Wishing to display his ability,
            Wukong leaped fifty or sixty feet into the air, pulling himself up with a somersault. He
            trod on the clouds for about the time of a meal and traveled a distance of no more than
            three miles before dropping down again to stand before the Patriarch. <em>"Master,"</em> he said,
            his hands folded in front of him, <em>"this is flying by cloud-soaring."</em> Laughing, the
            Patriarch said, <em>"This can't be called cloudsoaring! It's more like cloud-crawling! The
                old saying goes, The immortal tours the North Sea in the morning and reaches Cangwu
                by night.' If it takes you half a day to go less than three miles, it can't even be
                considered cloud-crawling."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"What do you mean,"</em> asked Wukong, <em>"by saying, "The immortal tours the North
                Sea in the morning and reaches Cangwu by night"?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Patriarch said, <em>"Those who are capable of cloud-soaring may start from the
                North Sea in the morning, journey through the East Sea, the West Sea, the South Sea,
                and return again to Cangwu. Cangwu refers to Lingling in the North Sea. It can be
                called true cloud-soaring only when you can traverse all four seas in one day."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"That's truly difficult!"</em> said Wukong, <em>"truly difficult!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Nothing in the world is difficult,"</em> said the Patriarch; <em>"only the mind makes it
                so."</em> When Wukong heard these words, he kowtowed reverently and implored the
            Patriarch, <em>"Master, if you do perform a service for someone, you must do it thoroughly.
                May you be most merciful and impart to me also this technique of cloud-soaring. I
                would never dare forget your gracious favor."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Patriarch said, <em>"When the various immortals want to soar on the clouds,
                they all rise by stamping their feet. But you're not like them. When I saw you leave just
                now, you had to pull yourself up by jumping. What I'll do now is to teach you the
                cloud-somersault in accordance with your form."</em> Wukong again prostrated himself and
            pleaded with him, and the Patriarch gave him an oral formula, saying, <em>"Make the magic
                sign, recite the spell, clench your fist tightly, shake your body, and when you jump up,
                one somersault will carry you one hundred and eight thousand miles."</em> When the other
            people heard this, they all giggled and said, <em>"Lucky Wukong! If he learns this little
                trick, he can become a dispatcher for someone to deliver documents or carry circulars.
                He'll be able to make a living anywhere!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The sky now began to darken, and the master went back to the cave dwelling
            with his pupils. Throughout the night, however, Wukong practiced ardently and
            mastered the technique of cloud-somersault. From then on, he had complete freedom,
            blissfully enjoying his state of long life.
        </p>
        <p>
            One day early in the summer, the disciples were gathered under the pine trees
            for fellowship and discussion. They said to him, <em>"Wukong, what sort of merit did you
                accumulate in another incarnation that led the master to whisper in your ear, the other
                day, the method of avoiding the three calamities? Have you learned everything?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"I won't conceal this from my various elder brothers,"</em> Wukong said, laughing.
            <em>"Owing to the master's instruction in the first place and my diligence day and night in
                the second, I have fully mastered the several matters!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Let's take advantage of the moment,"</em> one of the pupils said. <em>"You try to put on
                a performance and we'll watch."</em> When Wukong heard this, his spirit was aroused and
            he was most eager to display his powers. <em>"I invite the various elder brothers to give me
                a subject,"</em> he said. <em>"What do you want me to change into?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Why not a pine tree?"</em> they said. Wukong made the magic sign and recited the
            spell; with one shake of his body he changed himself into a pine tree. Truly it was
        </p>
        <blockquote><em>
                Thickly held in smoke through all four seasons,<br>
                Its chaste fair form soars straight to the clouds.<br>
                With not the least likeness to the impish monkey,<br>
                It's all frost-tried and snow-tested branches.</em></blockquote>
        <p>
            When the multitude saw this, they clapped their hands and roared with laughter,
            everyone crying, <em>"Marvelous monkey! Marvelous monkey!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            They did not realize that all this uproar had disturbed the Patriarch, who came
            running out of the door, dragging his staff.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Who is creating this bedlam here?"</em> he demanded. At his voice the pupils
            immediately collected themselves, set their clothes in order, and came forward. Wukong
            also changed back into his true form, and, slipping into the crowd, he said, <em>"For your
                information, Reverend Master, we are having fellowship and discussion here. There is
                no one from outside causing any disturbance."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"You were all yelling and screaming,"</em> said the Patriarch angrily, <em>"and were
                behaving in a manner totally unbecoming to those practicing cultivation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't you know that those in the cultivation of Dao resist
        </p>
        <blockquote><em>
                Opening their mouths lest they waste their breath and spirit,<br>
                Or moving their tongues lest they provoke arguments?</em></blockquote>
        <p><em>Why are you all laughing noisily here?"</em></p>
        <p>
            <em>"We dare not conceal this from the master,"</em> the crowd said. <em>"Just now we were
                having fun with Wukong, who was giving us a performance of transformation. We told
                him to change into a pine tree, and he did indeed become a pine tree! Your pupils were
                all applauding him and our voices disturbed the reverend teacher. We beg his
                forgiveness."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Go away, all of you,"</em> the Patriarch said. <em>"You, Wukong, come over here! I ask
                you what sort of exhibition were you putting on, changing into a pine tree? This ability
                you now possess, is it just for showing off to people? Suppose you saw someone with
                this ability. Wouldn't you ask him at once how he acquired it? So when others see that
                you are in possession of it, they'll come begging. If you're afraid to refuse them, you
                will give away the secret; if you don't, they may hurt you. You are actually placing your
                life in grave jeopardy."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"I beseech the master to forgive me,"</em> Wukong said, kowtowing. <em>"I won't
                condemn you,"</em> said the Patriarch, <em>"but you must leave this place."</em> When Wukong heard
            this, tears fell from his eyes. <em>"Where am I to go, Teacher?"</em> he asked. <em>"From wherever
                you came,"</em> the Patriarch said, <em>"you should go back there."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"I came from the East Pūrvavideha Continent,"</em> Wukong said, his memory jolted
            by the Patriarch, <em>"from the Water-Curtain Cave of the Flower-Fruit Mountain in the
                Aolai Country."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Go back there quickly and save your life,"</em> the Patriarch said. <em>"You cannot
                possibly remain here!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Allow me to inform my esteemed teacher,"</em> said Wukong, properly penitent, <em>"I
                have been away from home for twenty years, and I certainly long to see my subjects and
                followers of bygone days again. But I keep thinking that my master's profound kindness
                to me has not yet been repaid. I, therefore, dare not leave."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"There's nothing to be repaid,"</em> said the Patriarch. <em>"See that you don't get into
                trouble and involve me: that's all I ask."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Seeing that there was no other alternative, Wukong had to bow to the Patriarch
            and take leave of the congregation. <em>"Once you leave,"</em> the Patriarch said, <em>"you're bound
                to end up evildoing. I don't care what kind of villainy and violence you engage in, but I
                forbid you ever to mention that you are my disciple. For if you but utter half the word,
                I'll know about it; you can be assured, wretched monkey, that you'll be skinned alive. I
                will break all your bones and banish your soul to the Place of Ninefold Darkness, from
                which you will not be released even after ten thousand afflictions!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"I will never dare mention my master,"</em> said Wukong. <em>"I'll say that I've learned
                this all by myself."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Having thanked the Patriarch, Wukong turned away, made the magic sign,
            pulled himself up, and performed the cloud-somersault. He headed straight toward the
            East Pūrvavideha, and in less than an hour he could already see the Flower-Fruit
            Mountain and the Water-Curtain Cave. Rejoicing secretly, the Handsome Monkey King
            said to himself:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <em>"I left weighed down by bones of mortal stock.<br>
                The Dao attained makes light both body and frame.<br>
                Tis this world's pity that none firmly resolves<br>
                To learn such mystery that by itself is plain.<br>
                Twas hard to cross the seas in former time.<br>
                Returning this day, I travel with ease.<br>
                Words of farewell still echo in my ears.<br>
                I ne'er hope to see so soon the eastern depths!"</em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Wukong lowered the direction of his cloud and landed squarely on the FlowerFruit Mountain. He was trying to
            find his way when he heard the call of cranes and the
            cry of monkeys; the call of cranes reverberated in the Heavens, and the cry of monkeys
            moved his spirit with sadness. <em>"Little ones,"</em> he called out, <em>"I have returned!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            From the crannies of the cliff, from the flowers and bushes, and from the woods
            and trees, monkeys great and small leaped out by the tens of thousands and surrounded
            the Handsome Monkey King.
        </p>
        <p>
            They all kowtowed and cried, <em>"Great King! What laxity of mind! Why did you
                go away for such a long time and leave us here longing for your return like someone
                hungering and thirsting? Recently, we have been brutally abused by a monster, who
                wanted to rob us of our Water-Curtain Cave. Out of sheer desperation, we fought hard
                with him. And yet all this time, that fellow has plundered many of our possessions,
                kidnapped a number of our young ones, and given us many restless days and nights
                watching over our property. How fortunate that our great king has returned! If the great
                king had stayed away another year or so, we and the entire mountain cave would have
                belonged to someone else!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Hearing this, Wukong was filled with anger. <em>"What sort of a monster is this,"</em> he
            cried, <em>"that behaves in such a lawless manner? Tell me in detail and I will find him to
                exact vengeance."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Be informed, Great King,"</em> the monkeys said, kowtowing, <em>"that the fellow calls
                himself the Monstrous King of Havoc, and he lives north of here."</em> Wukong asked,
            <em>"From here to his place, how great is the distance?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The monkeys replied, <em>"He comes like the cloud and leaves like the mist, like the
                wind and the rain, like lightning and thunder. We don't know how great the distance is."</em>
            <em>"In that case,"</em> said Wukong, <em>"go and play for a while and don't be afraid. Let
                me go and find him."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Dear Monkey King! He leaped up with a bound and somersaulted all the way
            northward until he saw a tall and rugged mountain.
        </p>
        <p>
            What a mountain!
        </p>
        <blockquote><em>

        <p>
            The Handsome Monkey King was silently viewing the scenery when he heard
            someone speaking. He went down the mountain to find who it was, and he discovered
            the Water-Belly Cave at the foot of a steep cliff. Several imps who were dancing in
            front of the cave saw Wukong and began to run away. <em>"Stop!"</em> cried Wukong. <em>"You can
                use the words of your mouth to communicate the thoughts of my mind. I am the lord of
                the Water-Curtain Cave in the Flower-Fruit Mountain south of here. Your Monstrous
                King of Havoc, or whatever he's called, has repeatedly bullied my young ones, and I
                have found my way here with the specific purpose of sett ling matters with him."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Hearing this, the imps darted into the cave and cried out, <em>"Great King, a
                disastrous thing has happened!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"What sort of disaster?"</em> asked the Monstrous King. <em>"Outside the cave,"</em> said the
            imps, <em>"there is a monkey who calls himself the lord of the Water-Curtain Cave in the
                Flower-Fruit Mountain. He says that you have repeatedly bullied his young ones and
                that he has come to settle matters with you."</em> Laughing, the Monstrous King said, <em>"I
                have often heard those monkeys say that they have a great king who has left the family
                to practice self-cultivation. He must have come back. How is he dressed, and what kind
                of weapon does he have?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"He doesn't have any kind of weapon,"</em> the imps said. <em>"He is bare-headed, wears
                a red robe with a yellow sash, and has a pair of black boots on. He looks like neither a
                monk nor a layman, neither a Daoist nor an immortal. He is out there making demands
                with naked hands and empty fists."</em> When the Monstrous King heard this, he ordered,
            <em>"Get me my armor and my weapon."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            These were immediately brought out by the imps, and the Monstrous King put
            on his breastplate and helmet, grasped his scimitar, and walked out of the cave with his
            followers. <em>"Who is the lord of the Water-Curtain Cave?"</em> he cried with a loud voice.
            Quickly opening wide his eyes to take a look, Wukong saw that the Monstrous King
        </p>
        <blockquote><em>
                Wore on his head a black gold helmet<br>
                Which gleamed in the sun;<br>
                And on his body a dark silk robe<br>
                Which swayed in the wind;<br>
                Lower he had on a black iron vest<br>
                Tied tightly with leather straps;<br>
                His feet were shod in finely carved boots,<br>
                Grand as those of warriors great.<br>
                Ten spans—the width of his waist;<br>
                Thirty feet—the height of his frame;<br>
                He held in his hands a sword;<br>
                Its blade was fine and bright.<br>
                His name: the Monster of Havoc<br>
                Of most fearsome form and look.</em></blockquote>
        <p>
            <em>"You have such big eyes, reckless monster, but you can't even see old
                Monkey!"</em> the Monkey King shouted. When the Monstrous King saw him, he laughed
            and said, <em>"You're not four feet tall, nor are you thirty years old; you don't even have
                weapons in your hands.
        </p>
        <p>
            How dare you be so insolent, looking for me to settle accounts?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"You reckless monster!"</em> cried Wukong. <em>"You are blind indeed! You think I'm
                small, not knowing that it's hardly difficult for me to become taller; you think I'm
                without weapon, but my two hands can drag the moon down from the edge of Heaven.
                Don't be afraid; just have a taste of old Monkey's fist!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            He leaped into the air and aimed a blow smack at the monster's face. Parrying
            the blow with his hand, the Monstrous King said, <em>"You are such a midget and I'm so
                tall; you want to use your fist but I have my scimitar. If I were to kill you with it, I
                would be a laughingstock. Let me put down my scimitar, and we'll see how well you
                can box."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Well said, fine fellow,"</em> replied Wukong. <em>"Come on!"</em>
            The Monstrous King shifted his position and struck out. Wukong closed in on
            him, hurtling himself into the engagement. The two of them pummeled and kicked,
            struggling and colliding with each other. It is easy to miss on a long reach, but a short
            punch is firm and reliable. Wukong jabbed the Monstrous King in the short ribs, hit him
            on his chest, and gave him such heavy punishment with a few sharp blows that the
            monster stepped aside, picked up his huge scimitar, aimed it straight at Wukong's head,
            and slashed at him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wukong dodged, and the blow narrowly missed him. Seeing that his opponent
            was growing fiercer, Wukong now used the method called the Body beyond the Body.
            Plucking a handful of hairs from his own body and throwing them into his mouth, he
            chewed them to tiny pieces and then spat them into the air. <em>"Change!"</em> he cried, and they
            changed at once into two or three hundred little monkeys encircling the combatants on
            all sides. For you see, when someone acquires the body of an immortal, he can project
            his spirit, change his form, and perform all kinds of wonders. Since the Monkey King
            had become accomplished in the Way, every one of the eighty-four thousand hairs on
            his body could change into whatever shape or substance he desired. The little monkeys
            he had just created were so keen of eye and so swift of movement that they could be
            wounded by neither sword nor spear. Look at them! Skipping and jumping, they rushed
            at the Monstrous King and surrounded him, some hugging, some pulling, some crawling
            in between his legs, some tugging at his feet. They kicked and punched; they yanked at
            his hair and poked at his eyes; they pinched his nose and tried to sweep him completely
            off his feet, until they tangled themselves into confusion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile Wukong succeeded in snatching the scimitar, pushed through the
            throng of little monkeys, and brought the scimitar down squarely onto the monster's
            skull, cleaving it in two. He and the rest of the monkeys then fought their way into the
            cave and slaughtered all the imps, young and old. With a shake, he collected his hair
            back onto his body, but there were some monkeys that did not return to him. They were
            the little monkeys kidnaped by the Monstrous King from the Water-Curtain Cave.
            <em>"Why are you here?"</em> asked Wukong. The thirty or fifty of them all said
            tearfully, <em>"After the Great King went away to seek the way of immortality, the monster
                menaced us for two whole years and finally carried us off to this place. Don't these
                utensils belong to our cave? These stone pots and bowls were all taken by the creature."</em>
            <em>"If these are our belongings,"</em> said Wukong, <em>"move them out of here."</em>
            He then set fire to the Water-Belly Cave and reduced it to ashes. <em>"All of you,"</em> he
            said to them, <em>"follow me home."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Great King,"</em> the monkeys said, <em>"when we came here, all we felt was wind
                rushing past us, and we seemed to float through the air until we arrived here. We don't
                know the way. How can we go back to our home?"</em> Wukong said, <em>"That's a magic trick
                of his. But there's no difficulty! Now I know not only one thing but a hundred! I'm
                familiar with that trick too. Close your eyes, all of you, and don't be afraid."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Dear Monkey King. He recited a spell, rode for a while on a fierce wind, and
            then lowered the direction of the cloud. <em>"Little ones,"</em> he cried, <em>"open your eyes!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The monkeys felt solid ground beneath their feet and recognized their home
            territory. In great delight, every one of them ran back to the cave along the familiar
            roads and crowded in together with those waiting in the cave. They then lined up
            according to age and rank and paid tribute to the Monkey King. Wine and fruits were
            laid out for the welcome banquet. When asked how he had subdued the monster and
            rescued the young ones, Wukong presented a detailed rehearsal, and the monkeys broke
            into unending applause. <em>"Where did you go, Great King?"</em> they cried. <em>"We never
                expected that you would acquire such skills!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"The year I left you all,"</em> Wukong said, <em>"I drifted with the waves across the
                Great Eastern Ocean and reached the West Aparagodānīya Continent. I then arrived at
                the South Jambūdvīpa Continent, where I learned human ways, wearing this garment
                and these shoes. I swaggered along with the clouds for eight or nine years, but I had yet
                to learn the Great Art. I then crossed the Great Western Ocean and reached the West
                Aparagodānīya Continent.
        </p>
        <p>
            After searching for a long time, I had the good fortune to discover an old
            Patriarch, who imparted to me the formula for enjoying the same age as Heaven, the
            secret of immortality."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Such luck is hard to meet even after ten thousand afflictions!"</em> the monkeys
            said, all congratulating him. <em>"Little ones,"</em> Wukong said, laughing again, <em>"another
                delight is that our entire family now has a name."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"What is the name of the great king?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"My surname is Sun,"</em> replied Wukong, <em>"and my religious name is Wukong."</em>
            When the monkeys heard this, they all clapped their hands and shouted happily, <em>"If the
                great king is Elder Sun, then we are all Junior Suns, Suns the Third, small Suns, tiny
                Suns—the Sun Family, the Sun Nation, and the Sun Cave!"</em> So they all came and
            honored Elder Sun with large and small bowls of coconut and grape wine, of divine
            flowers and fruits. It was indeed one big happy family! Lo,
        </p>
        <blockquote><em>
                The surname is one, the self's returned to its source.<br>
                This glory awaits—a name recorded in Heaven!</em></blockquote>
        <p>
            We do not know what the result was and how Wukong would fare in this realm;
            let's listen to the explanation in the next chapter.
