FIFTY-FOUR
Dharma-nature, going west, reaches the Women State
Mind Monkey makes a plan to flee the fair sex
We tell you now about Tripitaka and his disciples, who left the household at the
village and followed the road westward. In less than forty miles, they arrived at the state
border of Western Liang. Pointing ahead as he rode along, the Tang Monk said,
“Wukong, we are approaching a city, and from the noise and hubbub coming from the
markets, I suppose it must be the Women State. All of you must take care to behave
properly. Keep your desires under control and don‟t let them violate the teachings of our
gate of Law.”
Hearing this, the three disciples obeyed the strict admonition.
Soon they reached the head of the street that opened to the eastern gate. The
people there, with long skirts and short blouses, powdered faces and oily heads, were all
women regardless of whether they were young or old. Many of them were doing
business on the streets, and when they saw the four of them walking by, they all clapped
their hands in acclaim and laughed aloud, crying happily, “Human seeds are coming!
Human seeds are coming!”
Tripitaka was so startled that he reined in his horse; all at once the street was
blocked, completely filled with women, and all you could hear were laughter and
chatter. Eight Rules began to holler wildly:
“I‟m a pig for sale! I‟m a pig for sale!”
“Idiot,” said Pilgrim, “stop this nonsense. Bring out your old features, that‟s
all!” Indeed, Eight Rules shook his head a couple of times and stuck up his two rushleaf fan ears; then he wriggled his lips like two hanging lotus roots and gave a yell, so
frightening those women that they all fell and stumbled. We have a testimonial poem,
and the it says:
The sage monk, seeking Buddha, reached Western Liang,
A land full of females but without one male.
Farmers, scholars, workers, and those in trade,
The fishers and plowers were women all.
Maidens lined the streets, crying “Human seeds!”
Young girls filled the roads to greet the comely men.
If Wuneng did not show his ugly face,
The siege by the fair sex would be pain indeed.
In this way, the people became frightened and none dared go forward; everyone
was rubbing her hands and squatting down. They shook their heads, bit their fingers,
and crowded both sides of the street, trembling all over but still eager to stare at the
Tang Monk.
The Great Sage Sun had to display his hideous face in order to open up the road,
while Sha Monk, too, played monster to keep order.
Leading the horse, Eight Rules stuck out his snout and waved his ears. As the
whole entourage proceeded, the pilgrims discovered that the houses in the city were
705
705
built in orderly rows while the shops had lavish displays. There were merchants selling
rice and salt; there were wine and tea houses—
All bell and drum towers with goods piled high;
Bannered kiosks and hostels with screens hung low.
As master and disciples followed the street through its several turns, they came
upon a woman official standing in the street and crying, “Visitors from afar should not
enter the city gate without permission. Please go to the post-house and enter your names
on the register. Allow this humble official to announce you to the throne. After your
rescript is certified, you will be permitted to pass through.”
Hearing this, Tripitaka dismounted; then he saw a horizontal plaque hung over
the gate of an official mansion nearby, and on the plaque were the three words, Male
Reception Post-house. “Wukong,” said the elder; “what that family in the village said is
true.
There is indeed a Male Reception Post-house.”
“Second Elder Brother,” said Sha Monk, laughing, “go and show yourself at the
Pregnancy Reflection Stream and see if there‟s a double reflection.”
Eight Rules replied, “Don‟t play with me! Since I drank that cup of water from
the Abortion Stream, the pregnancy has been dissolved. Why should I show myself?”
Turning around, Tripitaka said to him, “Wuneng, be careful with your words.”
He then went forward to greet the woman official, who led them inside the posthouse.
After they took their seats in the main hall, the official asked for tea to be served.
All the servants working here combed their hair into three braids, and their garments
were worn in two sections. Look at them! Even those serving tea were tittering. In a
moment, they finished tea, and the official rose and asked, “Where did the visitors come
from?” Pilgrim replied, “We are people from the Land of the East, sent by imperial
commission of the Great Tang Emperor to worship Buddha in the Western Heaven and
to seek scriptures. My master, the royal brother of the Tang emperor, bears the title of
Tripitaka Tang. I‟m Sun Wukong, his eldest disciple, and these two— Zhu Wuneng and
Sha Wujing—are my brothers. There are five of us altogether, including the horse. We
have with us a travel rescript, and we beg you to certify it so that we may pass through.”
After the woman official wrote this in the register with a brush, she came
forward to kowtow, saying, “Venerable Fathers, please pardon me. This humble official
is the clerk at the Male Reception Post-house. I did not know that such dignitaries from
a noble nation were on their way, and therefore I did not go to a distance to meet you.”
After she kowtowed, she rose and immediately gave an order to the housekeeper
to prepare food and drink. “Let the venerable fathers sit here for a while,” she said, “and
this humble official will enter the capital to present a memorial to our ruler. We will
certify your rescript and use our seals, so that you can be sent on your way to the West.”
Delighted, Tripitaka sat down and we shall leave him for the moment.
We tell you now about that clerk of the post-house, who, after she had put on the
proper attire, went to the Five Phoenix Tower inside the capital and said to the
Custodian of the Yellow Gate, “I‟m the clerk of the Male Reception Post-house, and I
must have an audience with the throne.”
706
706
The Yellow Gate at once presented the memorial, and the clerk was summoned
up to the main palace hall.
The queen asked, “Why does the Clerk of the post-house wish to see us?”
“Your humble subject,” said the clerk, “has just received in the post-house
Tripitaka Tang, the royal brother of the Great Tang Emperor in the Land of the East. He
has three disciples by the names of Sun Wukong, Zhu Wuneng, and Sha Wujing; there
are altogether five of them, including a horse. They are on their way to seek scriptures
from the Buddha in the Western Heaven. I have come especially to report this to my
queen and to ask whether they may have their travel rescript certified and the
permission to pass through.” When the queen heard this report, she was filled with
delight.
“Last night,” she said to the civil and military officials, “we dreamed that
Luminous hues grew from the screens of gold,
Refulgent rays spread from the mirrors of jade.
That had to be a good omen for today.”
“Mistress,” said the women officials in unison as they prostrated themselves
before the vermilion steps, “how could you tell that it was a good omen?”
The queen said, “This man from the Land of the East is a royal brother of the
Tang court. In our country, the rulers of various generations since the time when chaos
divided had never seen a man come here.
Now the royal brother of the Tang emperor has arrived, and he must be a gift
from Heaven. We will use the wealth of an entire nation to ask this royal brother to be
king; we are willing to be his queen. Such a sexual union will produce children and
grandchildren, and the perpetuity of our kingdom will be assured. When you consider
this, is not our dream a good omen?”
The women officials all kowtowed to express their delight and acclaim.
Then the clerk of the post-house said, “What our mistress has proposed is good
for extending the familial line to ten thousand generations. But those three disciples of
the royal brother are savage men; their appearances are most unsightly.”
“According to what you have seen, worthy subject, how does that royal brother
look?” asked the queen. “And how do his disciples look?”
“The royal brother,” said the clerk, “has features most dignified and handsome,
truly befitting a man who belongs to the Heavenly court of a noble nation, the China of
South Jambūdvīpa. His three disciples, however, have such savage looks that they
appear to be spirits.”
“In that case,” said the queen, “let us provide his disciples with some supplies
and certify the travel rescript for them. We shall send them off to the Western Heaven,
and only the royal brother will remain here. Anything wrong with that?”
Again the officials bowed to say, “The words of our mistress are most
appropriate, and your subjects obey your instruction. The affair of marriage, however,
requires a matchmaker, for as the ancients have declared,
The marriage contract depends on red leaves;
A couple‟s joined by the moon-man‟s scarlet threads.”
707
707
“We shall follow the counsel of our subjects,” replied the queen. “Let the
present Grand Preceptor serve as our marriage go-between, and the clerk of the Male
Reception Post-house as the one who officiates the ceremony. Let them go first to the
post-house to propose to the royal brother. If he consents, we shall take our carriage out
of the capital to receive him.”
The Grand Preceptor and the clerk accepted this decree and left the court.
We now tell you about Tripitaka and his disciples, who were just enjoying their
vegetarian meal at the hall of the post-house when someone came in to report:
“The Grand Preceptor and our own governess have arrived.”
Tripitaka said, “Why does the Grand Preceptor come here?”
“Perhaps the queen wants to give us an invitation,” said Eight Rules. “If not
that,” said Pilgrim, “then to offer a proposal of marriage.”
“Wukong,” said Tripitaka, “if they hold us and want to force us to marry them,
what shall we do?”
“Master,” replied Pilgrim, “just say Yes to them. Old Monkey will take care of
the matter.”
They had hardly finished speaking when the two women officials arrived and
bowed deeply to the elder, who returned their salutations one by one, saying, “This
humble cleric is someone who has left the family. What virtue or talent do I have that I
dare let you bow to me?” When the Grand Preceptor saw how impressive the elder
looked, she was delighted and thought to herself, “Our nation is truly quite lucky! Such
a man is most worthy to be the husband of our ruler.”
After the officials made their greetings, they stood on either side of the Tang
Monk and said, “Father royal brother, we wish you ten thousand happinesses!”
“I‟m someone who has left the family,” replied Tripitaka. “Where do those
happinesses come from?”
Again bending low, the Grand Preceptor said, “This is the Women State in the
Western Liang, and since time immemorial, there is not a single male in our country.
We are lucky at this time to have the arrival of father royal brother. Your subject, by the
decree of my ruler, has come especially to offer a proposal of marriage.”
“My goodness! My goodness!” said Tripitaka. “This poor monk has arrived at
your esteemed region all by himself, without the attendance of either son or daughter. I
have with me only three mischievous disciples, and I wonder to which of us is offered
this marriage proposal.”
The post-house clerk said, “Your lowly official just now went into court to
present my report, and my ruler, in great delight, told us of an auspicious dream she had
last night. She dreamed that
Luminous hues grew from the screens of gold,
Refulgent rays spread from the mirrors of jade.
When she learned that the royal brother is a man from the noble nation of China,
she was willing to use the wealth of her entire nation to ask you to be her live-in
husband. You would take the royal seat facing south to be called the man set apart from
others, and our ruler would be the queen. That was why she gave the decree for the
Grand Preceptor to serve as the marriage go-between and this lowly official to officiate
708
708
at the wedding. We came especially to offer you this proposal.” When Tripitaka heard
these words, he bowed his head and fell into complete silence. “When a man finds the
time propitious,” said the Grand Preceptor, “he should not pass up such an opportunity.
Though there is, to be sure, such a thing in the world as asking a husband to live in the
wife‟s family, the dowry of a nation‟s wealth is rare indeed. May we ask the royal
brother to give his quick consent, so that we may report to our ruler?”
The elder, however, became more dumb and deaf than ever.
Sticking out his pestlelike snout, Eight Rules shouted, “Grand Preceptor, go
back and tell your ruler that my master happens to be an arhat who has attained the Way
after a long process of cultivation. He will never fall in love with the dowry of a
nation‟s wealth, nor will he be enamored even with beauty that can topple an empire.
You may as well certify the travel rescript quickly and send them off to the West. Let
me stay here to be the live-in husband. How‟s that?” When the Grand Preceptor heard
this, her heart quivered and her gall shook, unable to answer at all. The clerk of the posthouse said, “Though you may be a male, your looks are hideous. Our ruler will not find
you attractive.”
“You are much too inflexible,” said Eight Rules, laughing. “As the proverb says,
The thick willow‟s a basket, the thin, a barrel—
Who in the world will take a man as an ugly fellow?”
Pilgrim said, “Idiot, stop this foolish talk. Let Master make up his mind: if he
wants to leave, let him leave, and if he wants to stay, let him stay. Let‟s not waste the
time of the marriage go-between.”
“Wukong,” said Tripitaka, “What do you think I ought to do?”
“In old Monkey‟s opinion,” replied Pilgrim, “perhaps it‟s good that you stay
here. As the ancients said, „One thread can tie up a distant marriage.‟ Where will you
ever find such a marvelous opportunity?”
Tripitaka said, “Disciple, if we remain here to dote on riches and glory, who will
go to acquire scriptures in the Western Heaven? Won‟t the waiting kill my emperor of
the Great Tang?”
The Grand Preceptor said, “In the presence of the royal brother, your humble
official dares not hide the truth. The wish of our ruler is only to offer you the proposal
of marriage. After your disciples have attended the wedding banquet, provisions will be
given them and the travel rescript will be certified, so that they may proceed to the
Western Heaven to acquire the scriptures.”
“What the Grand Preceptor said is most reasonable,” said Pilgrim, “and we need
not be difficult about this. We are willing to let our master remain here to become the
husband of your mistress. Certify our rescript quickly and send us off to the West.
When we have acquired the scriptures, we will return here to visit father and mother and
ask for travel expenses so that we may go back to the Great Tang.”
Both the Grand Preceptor and the clerk of the post-house bowed to Pilgrim as
they said, “We thank this teacher for his kind assistance in concluding this marriage.”
Eight Rules said, “Grand Preceptor, don‟t use only your mouth to set the table!
Since we have given our consent, tell your mistress to prepare us a banquet first. Let us
have an engagement drink. How about it?”
709
709
“Of course! Of course!” said the Grand Preceptor. “We‟ll send you a feast at
once.” In great delight, the Grand Preceptor left with the clerk of the posthouse.
We tell you now about our elder Tang, who caught hold of Pilgrim immediately
and berated him, crying, “Monkey head! Your tricks are killing me! How could you say
such things and ask me to get married here while you people go to the Western Heaven
to see Buddha? Even if I were to die, I would not dare do this.”
“Relax, Master,” said Pilgrim, “old Monkey‟s not ignorant of how you feel.
But since we have reached this place and met this kind of people, we have no
alternative but to meet plot with plot.”
“What do you mean by that?” asked Tripitaka.
Pilgrim said, “If you persist in refusing them, they will not certify our travel
rescript nor will they permit us to pass through. If they grow vicious and order many
people to cut you up and use your flesh to make those so-called fragrant bags, do you
think that we will treat them with kindness? We will, of course, bring out our abilities
that are meant to subdue demons and dispel fiends. Our hands and feet are quite heavy,
you know, and our weapons ferocious. Once we lift our hands, the people of this entire
nation will be wiped out.
But you must think of this, however. Although they are now blocking our path,
they are no fiendish creatures or monster-spirits; all of them in this country are humans.
And you have always been a man committed to kindness and compassion, refusing to
hurt even one sentient being on our way. If we slaughter all these common folk here,
can you bear it? That would be true wickedness.” When Tripitaka heard this, he said,
“Wukong, what you have just said is most virtuous. But I fear that if the queen asks me
to enter the palace, she will want me to perform the conjugal rite with her. How could I
consent to lose my original yang and destroy the virtue of Buddhism, to leak my true
sperm and fall from the humanity of our faith?”
“Once we have agreed to the marriage,” said Pilgrim, “she will no doubt follow
royal etiquette and send her carriage out of the capital to receive you. Don‟t refuse her.
Take a ride in her phoenix carriage and dragon chariot to go up to the treasure hall, and
then sit down on the throne facing south. Ask the queen to take out her imperial seal and
summon us brothers to go into court. After you have stamped the seal on the rescript,
tell the queen to sign the document also and give it back to us. Meanwhile, you can tell
them to prepare a huge banquet; call it a wedding feast as well as a farewell party for us.
After the banquet, ask for the chariot once more on the excuse that you want to
see us off outside the capital before you return to consummate the marriage with the
queen. In this way, both ruler and subjects will be duped into false happiness; they will
no longer try to block our way, nor will they have any cause to become vicious. Once
we reach the outskirts of the capital, you will come down from the dragon chariot and
Sha Monk will help you to mount the white horse immediately. Old Monkey will then
use his magic of immobility to make all of them, ruler and subjects, unable to move. We
can then follow the main road to the West. After one day and one night, I will recite a
spell to recall the magic and release all of them, so that they can wake up and return to
the city. For one thing, their lives will be preserved, and for another, your primal soul
will not be hurt. This is a plot called Fleeing the Net by a False Marriage. Isn‟t it a
doubly advantageous act?” When Tripitaka heard these words, he seemed as if he were
snapping out of a stupor or waking up from a dream. So delighted was he that he forgot
710
710
all his worries and thanked Pilgrim profusely, saying, “I‟m deeply grateful for my
worthy disciple‟s lofty intelligence.”
And so, the four of them were united in their decision, and we shall leave them
for the moment.
We tell you now about that Grand Preceptor and the clerk of the post-house,
who dashed inside the gate of the court without even waiting for summons and went
before the white-jade steps. “The auspicious dream of our mistress is most accurate,”
they cried, “and nuptial bliss will soon be yours.” When the queen heard this report, she
had the pearly screen rolled up; descending from the dragon couch, she opened her
cherry lips to reveal her silvery teeth and asked, full of smiles and in a most seductive
voice, “What did the royal brother say after our worthy subjects saw him?”
“After your subjects reached the post-house,” said the Grand Preceptor, “and
bowed to the royal brother, we immediately presented to him our proposal of marriage.
The royal brother still expressed some reluctance, but it was fortunate that his eldest
disciple gave his consent for them without hesitation. He was willing to let his master
become the husband of our ruler and call himself king, facing south. All he wanted was
to have their travel rescript certified so that the three of them could leave for the West.
On their way back after acquiring the scriptures, they will come here to bow to father
and mother and ask for travel expenses to go back to the Great Tang.”
“Did the royal brother say anything more?” asked the queen, smiling. The Grand
Preceptor said, “The royal brother did not say anything more, but he seemed to be
willing to marry our mistress.
His second disciple, however, wanted to drink to their consent first.” When the
queen heard this, she at once ordered the Court of Imperial Entertainments to prepare a
banquet. She also requested that her imperial cortege be readied so that she might go out
of the capital to receive her husband. The various women officials, in obedience to the
queen‟s command, began to sweep and clean the palaces and to prepare the banquet
with the utmost haste. Look at them! Though this State of Western Liang happens to be
a dominion of women, the carriage and chariot are not less opulent than those of China.
You see
Six dragons belching colors—
Two phoenixes bringing luck—
Six dragons, belching colors, support the chariot;
Two phoenixes, bringing luck, lift up the carriage.
Strange fragrance in endless waves;
Auspicious airs continuously rise.
Fish-pendants of gold or jade worn by many ministers;
Rows and rows of lovely locks and bejeweled hair.
A royal carriage shielded by mandarin-duck fans;
Through pearly screens glisten the phoenix hairpins.
Melodic pipes,
Harmonious strings.
What great sense of joy reaching to the sky!
What boundless bliss leaving the Estrade Numina.
Three-layered canopies wave above the royal house;
Five-colored banners light up the imperial steps.
This land has ne‟er seen the nuptial cup exchanged;
711
711
Today the queen marries a gifted man.
In a moment, the imperial cortege left the capital and arrived at the Male
Reception Post-house. Someone went inside to announce to Tripitaka and his disciples:
“The imperial cortege has arrived.” On hearing this, Tripitaka straightened out
his clothes and left the main hall with the three disciples to meet the carriage. As the
queen rolled up the screen to descend from the carriage, she asked, “Which is the royal
brother of the Tang court?” Pointing with her ringer, the Grand Preceptor said, “The one
in a clerical robe standing behind the incense table outside the post-house gate.” Lifting
her moth-brows and opening wide her phoenix-eyes, the queen stared at him and found
that this was an uncommon figure indeed. Look at him!
What handsome features!
What dignified looks!
Teeth white like silver bricks,
Ruddy lips and a square mouth.
His head‟s flat-topped, his forehead, wide and full;
Lovely eyes, neat eyebrows, and a chin that‟s long.
Two well-rounded ears betoken someone brave.
He is all elegance, a gifted man.
What a youthful, clever, and comely son of love,
Worthy to wed Western Liang‟s gorgeous girl!
Utterly ravished by what she saw, the queen was swept away by amorous
passion. Opening her tiny, cherrylike mouth, she cried out:
“Royal brother of the Great Tang, aren‟t you coming to take and ride the
phoenix?” When Tripitaka heard these words, his ears turned red and his face, scarlet;
filled with embarrassment, he dared not lift his head at all.
On one side, however, Zhu Eight Rules stuck up his snout and stared with glassy
eyes at the queen, who was quite beguiling herself.
Truly she had
Brows like kingfisher hair,
And flesh like mutt on jade.
Peach petals bedeck her face;
Her bun piles gold-phoenix hair.
Her eyes‟ cool, liquid gaze—such seductive charm.
Her hands‟ young, tender shoots—such dainty form.
Colors flutter from a red sash hung aslant;
Bright gleams flash forth from jade and pearl pinned high.
Don‟t speak of the beauty of Zhaojun,
She indeed surpasses even Xi Shi.
The willow waist bends slightly to gold-pendant sounds;
The light, lotus steps move the jadelike limbs.
The lunar goddess cannot come up to her,
Nor can the maids of Heaven compare with her.
Her fair, palace style‟s not of a worldly school;
She‟s like Queen Mother from Jasper Pool.
As our Idiot gazed at this pleasing figure, he could not restrain the saliva from
drooling out of his mouth and the deer pounding at his heart. All at once, he grew weak
712
712
and numb and simply melted away like a snow lion faced with fire! The queen went
forward and caught hold of Tripitaka. In a most seductive voice, she said, “Royal
brother darling, please ascend the dragon chariot so that we may go to the Treasure Hall
of Golden Chimes and become husband and wife.” Shaking so hard that he could barely
stand up, our elder behaved as if he were drunk or mesmerized. Pilgrim on one side
whispered to him, “Master, don‟t be too modest. Please get in the carriage with our
mistress. Go and have our rescript certified quickly so that we may proceed to fetch the
scriptures.”
The elder did not dare reply; he tugged at Pilgrim a couple of times and he could
no longer stop the tears from falling down. “Master, you must not be distressed,” said
Pilgrim. “Look at all these riches! If you don‟t enjoy them now, when are you going to
do it?”
Tripitaka had little alternative but to acquiesce. Wiping away his tears, he forced
himself to appear happy and joined the queen as they,
Holding hands together,
Rode the dragon carriage.
In great delight the queen wanted to get married;
In great fear the elder wished only to worship Buddha.
One desired amorous play in the bridal chamber;
One sought to see the World- Honored One at Mount Spirit.
The queen was sincere;
The monk pretended,
The queen was sincere,
Hoping to reach old age in harmony.
The monk pretended,
Guarding his feelings to nurse his primal spirit.
One was so glad to see a man
That she would couple with him in broad daylight.
One dreaded to meet a woman
And thought only to flee and go to Thunderclap.
The two mounted jointly the chariot.
Who knew Tang Monk was of another mind!
When those civil and military officials saw that their ruler and the Tang Monk
had ascended the phoenix carriage and sat side by side together, every one of them
beamed with pleasure. The entire entourage turned around and went back into the
capital.
Meanwhile, the Great Sage Sun told Sha Monk to pole the luggage and lead the
white horse to follow the imperial cortege. Zhu Eight Rules, however, scurried ahead
and ran madly up to the Tower of Five Phoenixes first, shouting all the while, “What
comfort! What an opportunity! But this can‟t be done until we have drunk the wedding
wine and presented ourselves to the kinfolk first.”
Those officials who were attending the cortege were so terrified that they went
to the chariot and said, “My Lady, that monk who has a long snout and huge ears is
shouting in front of the Five Phoenix Towers for wedding wine to drink.” When the
queen heard this, she leaned her fragrant shoulder over to the elder and put her
peachlike cheeks up to his face. Opening her scented mouth, she said softly, “Royal
brother darling, which disciple of yours is that one with a long snout and huge ears?”
713
713
“He‟s my second disciple,” said Tripitaka, “and he has a huge appetite. In fact,
he loves to indulge his mouth throughout his life. He must be given some food and
drink first before we can proceed with our business.”
The queen asked hurriedly, “Has the Court of Imperial Entertainments finished
preparing the banquet?”
“It has,” reported one of the officials. “There are both meat and vegetarian
dishes set up in the East Hall.”
“Why both?” asked the queen again. “We fear that the royal brother of the Tang
court,” said the official, “and his disciples are accustomed to keeping a vegetarian diet.
That is why we have both meat and vegetarian dishes.”
Full of smiles, the queen again snuggled close to the elder and said, “Royal
brother darling, do you eat meat, or are you keeping a vegetarian diet?”
Tripitaka said, “This humble priest observes a vegetarian diet, but my disciples
have not abstained from wine. My second disciple would like very much to have a few
cups of dietary wine.”
They had not finished speaking when the Grand Preceptor approached them and
said, “Please go to the East Hall to attend the banquet. Today is an auspicious day, and
Your Majesty can marry the venerable royal brother. Tomorrow Heaven will reveal the
Yellow Road, and we shall invite the venerable royal brother to ascend the treasure hall
and face south. He can then designate the name of his reign and assume the throne.”
Highly pleased, the queen held hands with the elder to descend from the dragon
chariot and enter the main palace gate. They were met by
Music divine, wind-waft ed from the towers,
As the jade carriage moved through palace gates.
Phoenix doors flung wide to bright flares of light;
The palace now opened with rows of brocade.
The unicorn hall was draped o‟er by incense smoke;
Bright corridors wound round the peacock screens.
Towers rose rugged like the noble state‟s,
With jade halls, gold horses more wondrous still.
When they reached the East Hall,
They heard a choir of melodious strings and pipes;
They saw two rows of winsome, graceful maids.
Two kinds of sumptuous repast were set up in the central hall: on the head table
to the left was the vegetarian spread, whereas meat dishes were placed on the right. Two
rows of single tables were also set up toward the front of the hall. Rolling up her sleeves
to reveal her dainty, pointed fingers, the queen immediately picked up a jade cup to
toast her guests. Pilgrim went forward to say, “We are all keeping a vegetarian diet. Let
our master be seated at the head table on the left. Then we three brothers may take the
single tables on both sides of him.”
“Yes! Yes!” said the Grand Preceptor in delight. “Master and disciples are just
like father and sons. They should not sit side by side.”
The various officials hurriedly set up the tables in proper order, after which the
queen toasted each of them as he took his seat. Thereafter, Pilgrim gave the Tang Monk
a look, indicating to his master to return the salutation. Tripitaka, therefore, left his seat
714
714
and, holding the jade goblet, also toasted the queen. The other civil and military
officials all knelt to thank the imperial favor before they took the other seats on both
sides according to their ranks. The music stopped and they began to drink and eat.
As Eight Rules was bent on satisfying his stomach, he had little regard for
consequence. It did not matter that the food before him was corn, steamed breads, sweet
pastries, butt on mushrooms, black mushrooms, tender bamboo shoots, wood-ears,
Chinese cabbage, seaweed, laver, green turnips, taros, white turnips, yams, or yellow
sperms—in big gulps, he finished them all, washing down the food with seven or eight
cups of wine. “Bring us more food!” he hollered. “Bring some big steins! After we
drink a few more steins, each of us will attend to our business.”
“Such a fine feast and you don‟t want to enjoy some more?” asked Sha Monk.
“What sort of business do you want to attend to?” With a laugh, our Idiot said, “As the
ancients said,
Let the bow-maker make his bow,
The arrow-maker his arrow.
At this time, those of us who want to take a wife may take a wife, and those of
us who want to marry a husband may marry a husband.
Those who want to acquire scriptures need to be on their way to acquire
scriptures. We can‟t let the coveted cup delay our affairs. Let‟s have our rescript
certified quickly. As the saying goes,
If the general does not dismount,
Every man will go his own way.”
When the queen heard this, she asked for big cups, and the attendants quickly
took out several parrot cups, cormorant-shaped ladles, gold beakers, silver chalices,
glass goblets, crystal basins, Penglai bowls, and amber steins. They filled these with the
mellowest of wines and all of the disciples drank a round.
Tripitaka then rose from the table and bowed to the queen with hands folded,
saying, “Your Majesty, thank you for this lavish feast.
We have drunk quite enough. Please ascend the treasure hall and certify our
rescript. While there is still light, let us send the three of them on their way.”
The queen agreed. After the banquet had been dismissed, she led the elder by the
hand up to the Hall of Golden Chimes and immediately wanted the elder to take the
throne. “No! No!” said Tripitaka. “Just now the Grand Preceptor said that tomorrow
would be the proper auspicious day, and only then would this poor monk dare assume
the throne and call myself the man set apart. Today you should use your seal on the
rescript so that they may be sent away.”
Again the queen agreed and sat down on the dragon couch. A golden highbacked chair was placed on the left of the couch for the Tang Monk to sit on. Then the
disciples were asked to bring forth the travel rescript. After Sha Monk untied the wrap
and took it out, the Great Sage presented the rescript with both hands to the queen.
When she examined it, she found on the document the marks of nine treasure seals of
the Great Tang Emperor, together with the seals of the Precious Image Kingdom, the
Black Rooster Kingdom, and the Cart Slow Kingdom. After the queen had looked at the
document, she said again, smiling seductively, “So royal brother darling also bears the
name of Chen?”

“That is the surname of my secular family,” said Tripitaka, “and my religious
name is Xuanzang. Because the Tang emperor in his imperial kindness took me as his
brother, he bestowed on me the name of Tang.”
“Why is it,” asked the queen, “that the rescript does not contain the names of
your disciples?”
“My three mischievous disciples,” replied Tripitaka, “are not people from the
Tang court.”
“If they are not,” asked the queen once more, “how is it that they are willing to
follow you on your journey?”
“My eldest disciple,” answered Tripitaka, “comes from the Aolai Country in the
East Pūrvavideha Continent; the second disciple, from a village in Qoco in the West
Aparagodānīya Continent; and the third, from the River of Flowing Sand. All three of
them had transgressed the decrees of Heaven. The Bodhisattva Guanshiyin, however,
liberated them from their sufferings, as a result of which they were willing to make
submission and hold fast the good. So that their merits might atone for their sins, they
resolved to accompany me and protect me on my journey to the Western Heaven to
acquire scriptures. Since they became my disciples when I was already on my way, their
names therefore had not been recorded on the rescript.”
“Let me add them on for you, all right?” asked the queen. Tripitaka replied,
“Your Majesty may do as you please.”
The queen asked at once for brush and ink; after the ink had been rubbed out and
the brush nicely soaked in it, she wrote at the end of the rescript declaration the names
of Sun Wukong, Zhu Wuneng, and Sha Wujing. Then she took out her imperial seal
with which she neatly stamped the rescript before she signed her own name. The
document was passed down again to the Great Sage Sun, who gave it to Sha Monk to
put into the wrap. Picking up a tray of small pieces of gold and silver, the queen left the
dragon couch to hand it to Pilgrim, saying, “Take this, the three of you, as travel money,
and may you reach the Western Heaven at an early date. When you return after you
have acquired the scriptures, we shall have greater rewards for you.” Pilgrim said, “We
are those who have left the family, and we cannot accept gold or silver. There will be
places on our way where we may beg for our living.” When the queen saw that he
refused, she took out ten bales of silk brocade and said to Pilgrim, “Since you are
rushing away, there‟s no time for measurement or sewing. Take this and have some
clothes made on the way to protect you from the cold.”
“Those who have left the family,” said Pilgrim, “are not permitted to wear silk
brocade. We have cloth garments to cover our bodies.” When the queen saw that he
refused again, she gave this order:
“Take three pints of imperial rice, and you can use it for a meal on the road.”
When Eight Rules heard the word “meal,” he at once accepted it and put the rice in the
wrap. “Brother,” said Pilgrim, “the luggage is getting heavier. You have the strength to
pole it?”
“You wouldn‟t know,” chuckled Eight Rules, “but what‟s good about rice is that
it‟s a product for daily consumption. One meal will finish it off.”
They all pressed their palms together to thank the queen.

Tripitaka said, “Let Your Majesty take the trouble to accompany this poor monk,
who will send them off outside the capital. Let me give them a few instructions so that
they may leave for the West. I will return and then I can enjoy forever with Your
Majesty riches and glory. Only without such burdens or cares can we enter into conjugal
bliss.”
The queen, of course, did not know that this was a trick, and she asked at once
for the imperial cortege. Leaning her fragrant shoulder on Tripitaka, she ascended the
phoenix carriage with him and proceeded to the west of the capital. At that time, all the
people in the capital lined the streets with containers filled with clean water and urns
with the finest incense. Wishing to see the cortege of the queen and the male form of the
royal brother were all powdered faces and cloudlike hair; old and young, they crowded
into the streets. In a moment, the imperial cortege went out of the capital and stopped
before the western gate.
After putting everything in order, Pilgrim, Eight Rules, and Sha Monk faced the
imperial carriage and cried out in unison, “The queen need not go any further. We shall
take our leave now.”
Descending slowly from the dragon chariot, the elder raised his hands toward
the queen and said, “Please go back, Your Majesty, and let this poor monk go to acquire
scriptures.” When the queen heard this, she paled with fright and tugged at the Tang
Monk. “Royal brother darling,” she cried, “I‟m willing to use the wealth of my entire
nation to ask you to be my husband. Tomorrow you shall ascend the tall treasure throne
to call yourself king, and I am to be your queen. You have even eaten the wedding feast.
Why are you changing your mind now?” When Eight Rules heard what she said, he
began to act as if he were delirious. Pouting his snout and flapping his ears wildly, he
charged up to the carriage, shouting, “How could we monks marry a powdered skeleton
like you? Let my master go on his journey!” When the queen saw that hideous face and
ugly behavior, she was scared out of her wits and fell back into the carriage. Sha Monk
pulled Tripitaka out of the crowd and was just helping him to mount the horse when
another girl dashed out from somewhere and shouted, “Royal brother Tang, where are
you going? Let‟s you and I make some love!”
“You stupid hussy!” cried Sha Monk and, whipping out his treasure staff,
brought it down hard on the head of the girl. Suddenly calling up a cyclone, the girl
carried away the Tang Monk with a loud whoosh and both of them vanished without a
trace. Alas! Thus it was that
Having just left the fair sex net,
Then the demon of love he met.
We do not know whether that girl is a human or a fiend, or whether the old
master will die or live; let‟s listen to the explanation in the next chapter.
