# Mind Monkey returns to the Right<br>The Six Robbers vanish from sight

Mind is the Buddha and the Buddha is Mind;
Both Mind and Buddha are important things.
If you perceive there‟s neither Mind nor Thing,
Yours is the dharmakāya of True Mind.
The dharmakāya
Has no shape or form:
One pearl-like radiance holding myriad things.
The bodiless body is the body true,
And real form is that form which has no form.
There‟s no form, no void, no no-emptiness;
No coming, no leaving, no pariṇāmanā;
No contrast, no sameness, no being or nonbeing:
No giving, no taking, no hopeful craving.
Light efficacious is in and out the same.
Buddha‟s whole realm is in a grain of sand.
A grain of sand the chiliocosm holds;
One mind or body‟s like ten thousand things.
To know this you must grasp the No-mind Spell;
Unclogged and taintless is the karma pure.
Don‟t do the many acts of good or ill:
This is true submission to Śākyamuni.

We were telling you about Tripitaka and Boqin, who, in fear and alarm, again
heard the cry, “My Master has come!” The various houseboys said, “It must be the old
ape in that stone box beneath the mountain who is shouting.”

“It‟s he! It‟s he!” said the Guardian. Tripitaka asked, “Who is this old ape?”

“The ancient name of this mountain,” said the Guardian, “was the Mountain of
Five Phases. It was changed to the Mountain of the Two Frontiers as a result of our
Great Tang ruler‟s western campaigns to secure his empire. A few years ago, I heard
from my elders that during the time when Wang Mang usurped the throne of the Han
emperor, this mountain fell from Heaven with a divine monkey clamped beneath it. He
feared neither heat nor cold, and he took neither food nor drink. He had been watched
and guarded by the spirits of the Earth, who fed him iron balls when he was hungry and
juices of bronze when he was thirsty. He has lasted from that time until now, surviving
both cold and hunger. He must be the one who is making all this noise. Don‟t be afraid,
Elder. Let‟s go down the mountain to take a look.”

Tripitaka had to agree and led his horse down the mountain. They had traveled
only a few miles when they came upon a stone box in which there was indeed a monkey
who, with his head sticking out, was waving his hands wildly and crying, “Master, why
have you taken so long to get here? Welcome! Welcome! Get me out, and I‟ll protect
you on your way to the Western Heaven!”

The priest went forward to look more closely at him. “How does he look?” you
ask.

A pointed mouth and hollow cheeks;
Two diamond pupils and fiery eyes.
Lichens had piled on his head;
Wisteria grew in his ears.
By his temples was more green grass than hair;
Beneath his chin, moss instead of a beard.
With mud on his brow,
And earth in his nose,
He looked most desperate!
His fingers coarse
And calloused palms
Were caked in filth and dirt!
Luckily, his eyes could still roll about,
And the apish tongue, articulate.
Though in speech he had great ease,
His body he could not move.
He was the Great Sage Sun of five hundred years ago.
Today his ordeal ends, he leaves Heaven‟s net.

Undeniably a courageous person, that Guardian Liu went up to the creature and
pulled away some of the grass at his temples and some of the moss beneath his chin. He
asked, “What do you have to say?”

“Nothing to you,” said the monkey, “but ask that master to come up here. I have
a question for him.”

“What‟s your question?” asked Tripitaka. “Are you someone sent by the great
king of the Land of the East to go seek scriptures in the Western Heaven?” asked the
monkey. “I am,” said Tripitaka. “Why do you ask?”

“I am the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven,” said the monkey, “who greatly
disturbed the Heavenly Palace five hundred years ago.

Because of my sin of rebellion and disobedience, I was imprisoned here by the
Buddha. Some time ago, a certain Bodhisattva Guanyin had received the decree of
Buddha to go to the Land of the East in quest of a scripture pilgrim. I asked her to give
me some help, and she persuaded me not to engage again in violence. I was told to
believe in the Law of Buddha and faithfully to protect the scripture pilgrim on his way
to worship Buddha in the West, for there would be a goodly reward reserved for me
when such merit is achieved. I have therefore been maintaining my vigilance night and
day, waiting for the Master to come to rescue me. I‟m willing to protect you in your
quest of scriptures and become your disciple.” When Tripitaka heard these words, he
was filled with delight and said, “Though you have this good intention, thanks to the
Bodhisattva‟s instruction, of entering our Buddhist fold, I have neither ax nor drill. How
can I free you?”

“No need for ax or drill,” said the monkey. “If you are willing to rescue me, I‟ll
be able to get out.”

Tripitaka said, “I‟m willing, but how can you get out?”

“On top of this mountain,” said the monkey, “there is a tag stamped with the
golden letters of our Buddha Tathāgata. Go up there and lift up the tag. Then I‟ll come
out.”

Tripitaka agreed and turned to Boqin, imploring him, “Guardian, come with me
up the mountain.”

“Do you think he‟s speaking the truth?” asked Boqin. “It‟s the truth!” the
monkey shouted. “I dare not lie!”

Boqin had no choice but to call his houseboys to lead the horses. He himself
supported Tripitaka with his hands, and they again started up the tall mountain. Tugging
at creepers and vines, they finally arrived at the highest peak, where they beheld ten
thousand shafts of golden light and a thousand folds of hallowed air. There was a huge
square slab of stone, on which was taped a seal with the golden letters, Oṁ maṇi padme
hūṁ. Tripitaka approached the stone and knelt down; he looked at the golden letters and
kowtowed several times to the stone. Then, facing the West, he prayed:

“Your disciple, Chen Xuanzang, was specifically commanded to seek scriptures
from you. If it is so ordained that he should be my disciple, let me lift up those golden
letters so that the divine monkey may find release and join me at the Spirit Mountain. If
he is not predestined to be my disciple, if he is only a cruel monster trying to deceive
me and to bring misfortune to our enterprise, let me not lift up this tape.”

He kowtowed again after he had prayed. Going forward, with the greatest of
ease he took down the golden letters. A fragrant wind swept by immediately and blew
the tag out of his hands into the air as a voice called out, “I am the prison guard of the
Great Sage. Today his ordeal is completed, and my colleagues and I are returning this
seal to Tathāgata.” Tripitaka, Boqin, and their followers were so terrified that they fell
on the ground and bowed toward the sky.They then descended from the tall mountain
and came back to the stone box, saying to the monkey, “The tag has been lifted. You
may come out.”

Delighted, the monkey said, “Master, you had better walk away from here so
that I can come out. I don‟t want to frighten you.” When Boqin heard this, he led
Tripitaka and the rest of the company to walk back eastward for five or six miles. Again
they heard the monkey yelling, “Further still! Further still!” So Tripitaka and the others
went still further until they had left the mountain. All at once came a crash so loud that
it was as if the mountain was cracking and the earth splitting wide open; everyone was
awestruck. The next moment the monkey was already in front of Tripitaka‟s horse;
completely naked, he knelt down and cried, “Master, I‟m out!”

He bowed four times toward Tripitaka, and then, jumping up, he said to Boqin
respectfully, “I thank Elder Brother for taking the trouble of escorting my master. I‟m
grateful also for your shaving the grass from my face.”

Having thanked him, he went at once to put the luggage in order so that it could
be tied onto the horse‟s back. When the horse saw him, its torso slackened and its legs
stiffened. In fear and trembling, it could hardly stand up. For you see, that monkey had
been a Ban-Horse-Plague, who used to look after dragon horses in the celestial stables.
His authority was such that horses of this world inevitably would fear him when they
saw him.

When Tripitaka saw that the monkey was truly a person of good intentions,
someone who truly resembled those who had embraced the Buddhist faith, he called to
him, “Disciple, what is your surname?”

“My surname is Sun,” said the Monkey King. “Let me give you a religious
name,” said Tripitaka, “so that it will be convenient to address you.”

“This noble thought of the master is deeply appreciated,” said the Monkey King,
“but I already have a religious name. I‟m called Sun Wukong.”

“It exactly fits the emphasis of our denomination,” said Tripitaka, delighted.
“But look at you, you look rather like a little dhūta. Let me give you a nickname and
call you Pilgrim Sun. How‟s that?”

“Good! Good!” said Wukong. So from then on, he was also called Pilgrim Sun.
When Boqin saw that Pilgrim Sun was definitely preparing to leave, he turned to
speak respectfully to Tripitaka, saying, “Elder, you are fortunate to have made an
excellent disciple here. Congratulations! This person should be most fit to accompany
you. I must take leave of you now.”

Bowing to thank him, Tripitaka said, “I cannot thank you enough for all your
kindness. Please be certain to thank your dear mother and wife when you return to your
house. I have caused you all great inconvenience, and I shall thank you again on my
way back.”

Boqin returned his salutation, and they parted.

We shall now tell you about Pilgrim Sun, who asked Tripitaka to mount his
horse. He himself, stark naked, carried the luggage on his back and led the way. In a
little while, as they were passing the Mountain of Two Frontiers, they saw a fierce tiger
approaching, growling and waving its tail. Tripitaka, sitting on his horse, became
alarmed, but Pilgrim, walking at the side of the road, was delighted. “Don‟t be afraid,
Master,” he said, “for he‟s here to present me with some clothes.”

He put down the luggage and took a tiny needle out of his ears. One wave of it
facing the wind, and it became an iron rod with the thickness of a rice bowl. He held it
in his hands and laughed, saying, “I haven‟t used this treasure for over five hundred
years! Today I‟m taking it out to bag a little garment for myself.” Look at him! He
strode right up to the tiger, crying, “Cursed beast! Where do you think you‟re going?”

Crouching low, the tiger lay prone on the dust and dared not move. Pilgrim Sun
aimed the rod at its head, and one stroke caused its brain to burst out like ten thousand
red petals of peach blossoms, and the teeth to fly out like so many pieces of white jade.
So terrified was our Chen Xuanzang that he fell off his horse. “O God! O God!” he
cried, biting his fingers. “When Guardian Liu overcame that striped tiger the other day,
he had to do battle with him for almost half a day. But without even fighting today, Sun
Wukong reduces the tiger to pulp with one blow of his rod. How true is the saying, „For
the strong, there‟s always someone stronger!‟” “Master,” said Pilgrim as he returned
dragging the tiger, “sit down for awhile, and wait till I have stripped him of his clothes.

When I put them on, we‟ll start off again.”

“Where does he have any clothes?” asked Tripitaka. “Don‟t mind me, Master,”
said Pilgrim, “I have my own plan.”

Dear Monkey King! He pulled off one strand of hair and blew a mouthful of
magic breath onto it, crying, “Change!” It changed into a sharp, curved knife, with
which he ripped open the tiger‟s chest. Slitting the skin straight down, he then ripped it
off in one piece. He chopped away the paws and the head, cutting the skin into one
square piece. He picked it up and tried it for size, and then said, “It‟s a bit too large; one
piece can be made into two.”

He took the knife and cut it again into two pieces; he put one of these away and
wrapped the other around his waist. Ripping off a strand of rattan from the side of the
road, he firmly tied on this covering for the lower part of his body. “Master,” he said,
“let‟s go! Let‟s go! When we reach someone‟s house, we will have sufficient time to
borrow some threads and a needle to sew this up.”

He gave his iron rod a squeeze and it changed back into a tiny needle, which he
stored in his ear. Throwing the luggage on his back, he asked his Master to mount the
horse. As they set off, the monk asked him, “Wukong, how is it that the iron rod you
used to slay the tiger has disappeared?”

“Master,” said Pilgrim laughing, “you have no idea what that rod of mine really
is. It was acquired originally from the Dragon Palace in the Eastern Ocean. It‟s called
the Precious Divine Iron for Guarding the Heavenly River, and another name of it is the
Compliant Golden-Hooped Rod. At the time when I revolted against Heaven, I
depended on it a great deal; for it could change into any shape or form, great or small,
according to my wish. Just now I had it changed into a tiny embroidery needle, and it‟s
stored that way in my ear. When I need it, I‟ll take it out.” Secretly pleased by what he
heard, Tripitaka asked another question:

“Why did that tiger become completely motionless when it saw you? How do
you explain the fact that it simply let you hit it?”

“To tell you the truth,” said Wukong, “even a dragon, let alone this tiger, would
behave itself if it had seen me! I, old Monkey, possess the ability to subdue dragons and
tame tigers, and the power to overturn rivers and stir up oceans. I can look at a person‟s
countenance and discern his character; I can listen merely to sounds and discover the
truth. If I want to be big, I can fill the universe; if I want to be small, I can be smaller
than a piece of hair. In sum, I have boundless ways of transformation and incalculable
means of becoming visible or invisible. What‟s so strange, then, about my skinning a
tiger? Wait till we come to some real difficulties—you‟ll see my talents then!” When
Tripitaka heard these words, he was more relieved than ever and urged his horse
forward. So master and disciple, the two of them, chatted as they journeyed, and soon
the sun sank in the west. You see

Soft glow of the fading twilight,
And distant clouds slowly returning.
On every hill swells the chorus of birds,
Flocking to shelter in the woods.
The wild beasts in couples and pairs,
In packs and groups they trek homeward.
The new moon, hooklike, breaks the spreading gloom
With ten thousand stars luminous.

Pilgrim said, “Master, let‟s move along, for it‟s getting late. There are dense
clumps of trees over there, and I suppose there must be a house or village too. Let‟s
hurry over there and ask for lodging.” Urging his horse forward, Tripitaka went straight
up to a house and dismounted. Pilgrim threw down the bag and went to the door, crying,
“Open up! Open up!”

An old man came to the door, leaning on a cane. When he pulled open the
creaking door, he was panic-stricken by the hideous appearance of Pilgrim, who had the
tiger skin around his waist and looked like a thunder god. He began to shout, “A ghost!
A ghost!” and other such foolish words. Tripitaka drew near and took hold of him,
saying, “Old Patron, don‟t be afraid. He is my disciple, not a ghost.” Only when he
looked up and saw the handsome features of Tripitaka did the old man stand still.
“Which temple are you from,” he asked, “and why are you bringing such a nasty
character to my door?”

“I am a poor monk from the Tang court,” said Tripitaka, “on my way to seek
scriptures from Buddha in the Western Heaven. We were passing through here and it
was getting late; that is why we made so bold as to approach your great mansion and
beg you for a night‟s lodging. We plan to leave tomorrow before it‟s light, and we
beseech you not to deny our request.”

“Though you may be a Tang man,” the old man said, “that nasty character is
certainly no Tang man!”

“Old fellow!” cried Wukong in a loud voice, “you really can‟t see, can you? The
Tang man is my master, and I am his disciple. Of course, I‟m no sugar man or honey
man! I am the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven! The members of your family should
recognize me. Moreover, I have seen you before.”

“Where have you seen me before?”

“When you were young,” said Wukong, “didn‟t you gather firewood before my
eyes? Didn‟t you haul vegetables before my face?”

The old man said, “That‟s nonsense! Where did you live? And where was I, that
I should have gathered firewood and hauled vegetables before your eyes?”
“Only my son would talk nonsense!” said Wukong. “You really don‟t recognize
me! Take a closer look! I am the Great Sage in the stone box of this Mountain of Two
Frontiers.”

“You do look somewhat like him,” said the old man, half recognizing the figure
before him, “but how did you get out?” Wukong thereupon gave a thorough account of
how the Bodhisattva had converted him and how she had asked him to wait for the Tang
Monk to lift the tag for his deliverance.

After that, the old man bowed deeply and invited Tripitaka in, calling for his
aged wife and his children to come out and meet the guests. When he told them what
had happened, everyone was delighted. Tea was then served, after which the old man
asked Wukong, “How old are you, Great Sage?”

“And how old are you?” asked Wukong. “I have lived foolishly for one hundred
and thirty years!” said the old man. “You are still my great-great-great-great-grandson!”
said Pilgrim. “I can‟t remember when I was born, but I have spent over five hundred
years underneath this mountain.”

“Yes, yes,” said the old man. “I remember my great-grandfather saying that
when this mountain dropped from the sky, it had a divine ape clamped underneath it. To
think that you should have waited until now for your freedom! When I saw you in my
childhood, you had grass on your head and mud on your face, but I wasn‟t afraid of you
then.

Now without mud on your face and grass on your head, you seem a bit thinner.
And with that huge piece of tiger skin draped around your waist, what great difference
is there between you and a demon?” When the members of his family heard this remark,
they all roared with laughter. Being a rather decent fellow, that old man at once ordered
a vegetarian meal to be prepared. Afterwards Wukong said, “What is your family
name?”

“Our humble family,” said the old man, “goes by the name of Chen.” When
Tripitaka heard this, he left his seat to salute him, saying, “Old Patron, you and I share
the same illustrious clan.”

“Master,” said Pilgrim, “your surname is Tang. How can it be that you and he
share the same illustrious ancestors?”

Tripitaka said, “The surname of my secular family is also Chen, and I come
from the Juxian Village, in the Hongnong District of Haizhou in the Tang domain. My
religious name is Chen Xuanzang. Because our Great Tang Emperor Taizong made me
his brother by decree, I took the name Tripitaka and used Tang as my surname. Hence
I‟m called the Tang Monk.”

The old man was very pleased to hear that they had the same surname.

“Old Chen,” said Pilgrim, “I must trouble your family some more, for I haven‟t
taken a bath for five hundred years! Please go and boil some water so that my master
and I, his disciple, can wash ourselves. We shall thank you all the more when we leave.”
The old man at once gave the order for water to be boiled and basins to be
brought in with several lamps. As master and disciple sat before the lamps after their
baths, Pilgrim said, “Old Chen, I still have one more favor to ask of you. Can you lend
me a needle and some thread?”

“Of course, of course,” replied the old man. One of the amahs was told to fetch
the needle and thread, which were then handed over to Pilgrim. Pilgrim, you see, had
the keenest sight; he noticed that Tripitaka had taken off a shirt made of white cloth and
had not put it on again after his bath. Pilgrim grabbed it and put it on himself. Taking
off his tiger skin, he sewed the hems together using a “horse-face fold” and fastened it
round his waist again with the strand of rattan. He paraded in front of his master saying,
“How does old Monkey look today compared with the way he looked yesterday?”

“Very good,” said Tripitaka, “very good! Now you do look like a pilgrim! If you
don‟t think that the shirt is too worn or old, you may keep it.”

“Thanks for the gift!” said Wukong respectfully. He then went out to find some
hay to feed the horse, after which master and disciple both retired with the old man and
his household.

The next morning Wukong arose and woke up his master to get ready for the
journey. Tripitaka dressed himself while Wukong put their luggage in order. They were
about to leave when the old man brought in washing water and some vegetarian food,
and so they did not set out until after the meal. Tripitaka rode his horse with Pilgrim
leading the way; they journeyed by day and rested by night, taking food and drink
according to their needs. Soon it was early winter. You see

Frost-blighted maples and the wizened trees;
Few verdant pine and cypress still on the ridge.
Budding plum blossoms spread their gentle scent.
The brief, warm day—
A Little Spring gift!
But dying lilies yield to the lush wild tea.
A cold bridge struggles against an old tree‟s bough,
And gurgling water flows in the winding brook.
Gray clouds, snow-laden, float throughout the sky.
The strong, cold wind
Tears at the sleeve!
How does one bear this chilly might of night?

Master and disciple had traveled for some time when suddenly six men jumped
out from the side of the road with much clamor, all holding long spears and short
swords, sharp blades and strong bows. “Stop, monk!” they cried. “Leave your horse and
drop your bag at once, and we‟ll let you pass on alive!”

Tripitaka was so terrified that his soul left him and his spirit fled; he fell from his
horse, unable to utter a word. But Pilgrim lifted him up, saying, “Don‟t be alarmed,
Master. It‟s nothing really, just some people coming to give us clothes and a travel
allowance!”

“Wukong,” said Tripitaka, “you must be a little hard of hearing! They told us to
leave our bag and our horse, and you want to ask them for clothes and a travel
allowance?”

“You just stay here and watch our belongings,” said Pilgrim, “and let old
Monkey confront them. We‟ll see what happens.”

Tripitaka said, “Even a good punch is no match for a pair of fists, and two fists
can‟t cope with four hands! There are six big fellows over there, and you are such a tiny
person. How can you have the nerve to confront them?”

As he always had been audacious, Pilgrim did not wait for further discussion. He
walked forward with arms folded and saluted the six men, saying, “Sirs, for what reason
are you blocking the path of this poor monk?”

“We are kings of the highway,” said the men, “philanthropic mountain lords.
Our fame has long been known, though you seem to be ignorant of it. Leave your
belongings at once, and you will be allowed to pass. If you but utter half a no, you‟ll be
chopped to pieces!”

“I have been also a great hereditary king and a mountain lord for centuries,” said
Pilgrim, “but I have yet to learn of your illustrious names.”

“So you really don‟t know!” one of them said. “Let‟s tell you then: one of us is
named Eye That Sees and Delights; another, Ear That Hears and Rages; another Nose
That Smells and Loves; another, Tongue That Tastes and Desires; another, Mind That
Perceives and Covets; and another, Body That Bears and Suffers.”

“You are nothing but six hairy brigands,” said Wukong laughing, “who have
failed to recognize in me a person who has left the family, your proper master. How
dare you bar my way? Bring out the treasures you have stolen so that you and I can
divide them into seven portions. I‟ll spare you then!”

Hearing this, the robbers all reacted with rage and amusement, covetousness and
fear, desire and anxiety. They rushed forward crying, “You reckless monk! You haven‟t
a thing to offer us, and yet you want us to share our loot with you!” Wielding spears and
swords, they surrounded Pilgrim and hacked away at his head seventy or eighty times.
Pilgrim stood in their midst and behaved as if nothing were happening.

“What a monk!” said one of the robbers. “He really does have a hard head!”
“Passably so!” said Pilgrim, laughing. “But your hands must be getting tired
from all that exercise; it‟s about time for old Monkey to take out his needle for a little
entertainment.”

“This monk must be an acupuncture man in disguise,” said the robber. “We‟re
not sick! What‟s all this about using a needle?” Pilgrim reached into his ear and took out
a tiny embroidery needle; one wave of it in the wind and it became an iron rod with the
thickness of a rice bowl.

He held it in his hands, saying, “Don‟t run! Let old Monkey try his hand on you
with this rod!”

The six robbers fled in all directions, but with great strides he caught up with
them and rounded all of them up. He beat every one of them to death, stripped them of
their clothes, and seized their valuables. Then Pilgrim came back smiling broadly and
said, “You may proceed now, Master. Those robbers have been exterminated by old
Monkey.”

“That‟s a terrible thing you have done!” said Tripitaka. “They may have been
strong men on the highway, but they would not have been sentenced to death even if
they had been caught and tried. If you have such abilities, you should have chased them
away. Why did you slay them all? How can you be a monk when you take life without
cause? We who have left the family should

Keep ants out of harm‟s way when we sweep the floor,
And put shades on lamps for the love of moths.

How can you kill them just like that, without regard for black or white? You
showed no mercy at all! It‟s a good thing that we are here in the mountains, where any
further investigation will be unlikely. But suppose someone offends you when we reach
a city and you perpetrate violence again, hitting people indiscriminately with that rod of
yours—would I be able to remain innocent and get away scot-free?”

“Master,” said Wukong, “if I hadn‟t killed them, they would have killed you!”
Tripitaka said, “As a priest, I would rather die than practice violence. If I were
killed, there would be only one of me, but you slaughtered six persons. How can you
justify that? If this matter were brought before a judge, and even if your old man were
the judge, you certainly would not be able to justify your action.”

“To tell you the truth, Master,” said Pilgrim, “when I, old Monkey, was king on
the Flower-Fruit Mountain five hundred years ago, I killed I don‟t know how many
people. I would not have been a Great Sage, Equal to Heaven, if I had lived by what you
are saying.”

“It‟s precisely because you had neither scruples nor self-control,” said Tripitaka,
“unleashing your waywardness on Earth and spreading outrage in Heaven, that you had
to undergo this ordeal of five hundred years. Now that you have entered the fold of
Buddhism, if you still insist on practicing violence and indulge in the taking of life as
before, you are not worthy to be a monk, nor can you go to the Western Heaven. You‟re
wicked! You‟re just too wicked!” Now this monkey had never in all his life been able to
tolerate scolding. When he heard Tripitaka‟s persistent reprimand, he could not suppress
the flames leaping up in his heart. “If that‟s what you think,” he said. “If you think I‟m
not worthy to be a monk, nor can I go to the Western Heaven, you needn't bother me
further with your nagging! I‟ll leave and go back!”

Before Tripitaka had time to reply, Pilgrim was already so enraged that he
leaped into the air, crying only, “Old Monkey‟s off!”

Tripitaka quickly raised his head to look, but the monkey had already
disappeared, trailed only by a swishing sound fading fast toward the East. Left by
himself, the priest could only shake his head and sigh, “That fellow! He‟s so unwilling
to be taught! I only said a few words to him. How could he vanish without a trace and
go back just like that? Well, well, well! It must be also that I am destined not to have a
disciple or any other companion, for now I couldn‟t even call him or locate him if I
wanted to. I might as well go on by myself!” So, he was prepared to

Lay down his life and go toward the West,
To be his own master and on none rely.

The elder had little alternative but to pack up his bag and put it on the horse,
which he did not even bother to mount. Holding his staff in one hand and the reins in
the other, he set off sadly toward the West. He had not traveled far when he saw an old
woman before him on the mountain road, holding a silk garment and a cap with a floral
design. When Tripitaka saw her approach, he hastened to pull his horse aside for her to
pass. “Elder, where do you come from,” asked the old woman, “and why are you
walking here all by yourself?”

Tripitaka replied, “Your child was sent by the Great King of the Land of the East
to seek true scriptures from the living Buddha in the Western Heaven.”
“The Buddha of the West,” said the old woman, “lives in the Great Temple of
Thunderclap in the territory of India, and the journey there is one hundred and eight
thousand miles long. You are all by yourself, with neither a companion nor a disciple.
How can you possibly think of going there?”

“A few days ago,” said Tripitaka, “I did pick up a disciple, a rather unruly and
headstrong character. I scolded him a little, but he refused to be taught, and
disappeared.”

The old woman said, “I have here a silk shirt and a flower cap inlaid with gold,
which used to belong to my son. He had been a monk for only three days when
unfortunately he died. I have just finished mourning him at the temple, where I was
given these things by his master to be kept in his memory. Father, since you have a
disciple, I‟ll give the shirt and the cap to you.”

“I‟m most grateful for your lavish gifts,” said Tripitaka, “but my disciple has
left. I dare not take them.”

“Where did he go?” asked the old woman. Tripitaka replied, “I heard a swishing
sound heading toward the east.”

“My home is not too far away in the east,” said the old woman, “and he may be
going there.

I have a spell which is called the True Words for Controlling the Mind, or the
Tight-Fillet Spell. You must memorize it secretly; commit it firmly to your memory,
and don‟t let anyone learn of it. I‟ll try to catch up with him and persuade him to come
back and follow you. When he returns, give him the shirt and the cap to wear; and if he
again refuses to obey you, recite the spell silently. He will not dare do violence or leave
you again.” On hearing these words, Tripitaka bowed his head to thank her. The old
woman changed herself into a shaft of golden light and vanished toward the east. Then
Tripitaka realized that it was the Bodhisattva Guanyin who had taught him the True
Words; he hurriedly picked up a few pinches of earth with his fingers and scattered
them like incense, bowing reverently toward the East. He then took the shirt and the cap
and hid them in his bag. Sitting beside the road, he began to recite the True Words for
Controlling the Mind.

After a few times, he knew it thoroughly by heart, but we shall speak no more of
him for the time being.

We now tell you about Wukong, who, having left his master, headed straight
toward the Eastern Ocean with a single cloud somersault. He stopped his cloud, opened
up a path in the water, and went directly to the Water Crystal Palace. Learning of his
arrival, the Dragon King came out to welcome him. After they had exchanged greetings
and sat down, the Dragon King said, “I heard recently that the ordeal of the Great Sage
had been completed, and I apologize for not having congratulated you yet. I suppose
you have again taken occupancy in your immortal mountain and returned to the ancient
cave.”

“I was so inclined,” said Wukong, “but I became a monk instead.”

“What sort of a monk?” asked the Dragon King. “I was indebted to the
Bodhisattva of South Sea,” said Pilgrim, “who persuaded me to do good and seek the
truth. I was to follow the Tang Monk from the Land of the East to go worship Buddha
in the West. Since entering the fold of Buddhism, I was given also the name „Pilgrim.‟”
“That is indeed praiseworthy!” said the Dragon King. “You have, as we say, left the
wrong and followed the right; you have been created anew by setting your mind on
goodness. But if that‟s the case, why are you not going toward the West, but are
returning eastward instead?” Pilgrim laughed and said, “That Tang Monk knows
nothing of human nature! There were a few ruffians who wanted to rob us, and I slew
them all. But that Tang Monk couldn‟t stop nagging me, telling me over and over how
wrong I was. Can you imagine old Monkey putting up with that sort of tedium? I just
left him! I was on my way back to my mountain when I decided to come visit you and
ask for a cup of tea.”

“Thanks for coming! Thanks for coming!” exclaimed the Dragon King. At that
moment, the Dragon sons and grandsons presented them with aromatic tea. When they
finished the tea, Pilgrim happened to turn around and saw hanging behind him on the
wall a painting on the “Presentation of Shoes at Yi Bridge.”

“What‟s this all about?” asked Pilgrim. The Dragon King replied, “The incident
depicted in the painting took place some time after you were born, and you may not
recognize what it was—the threefold presentation of shoes at Yi Bridge.”

“What do you mean by the threefold presentation of shoes?” asked Pilgrim.

“The immortal in the painting,” said the Dragon King, “was named Huang
Shigong, and the young man kneeling in front of him was called Zhang Liang.

Shigong was sitting on the Yi Bridge when suddenly one of his shoes fell off
and dropped under the bridge.

He asked Zhang Liang to fetch it, and the young man quickly did so, putting it
back on for him as he knelt there. This happened three times. Since Zhang Liang did not
display the slightest sign of pride or impatience, he won the affection of Shigong, who
imparted to him that night a celestial manual and told him to support the house of Han.
Afterwards, Zhang Liang „made his plans sitting in a military tent to achieve victories a
thousand miles away.‟

When the Han dynasty was established, he left his post and went into the
mountains, where he followed the Daoist, Master Red Pine, and became enlightened in
the way of immortality. Great Sage, if you do not accompany the Tang Monk, if you are
unwilling to exercise diligence or to accept instruction, you will remain a bogus
immortal after all. Don‟t think that you‟ll ever acquire the Fruits of Truth.” Wukong
listened to these words and fell silent for some time. The Dragon King said, “Great
Sage, you must make the decision yourself. It‟s unwise to allow momentary comfort to
jeopardize your future.”

“Not another word!” said Wukong. “Old Monkey will go back to accompany
him, that‟s all!”

Delighted, the Dragon King said, “If that‟s your wish, I dare not detain you.
Instead, I ask the Great Sage to show his mercy at once and not permit his master to
wait any longer.” When Pilgrim heard this exhortation to leave, he bounded right out of
the oceanic region; mounting the clouds, he left the Dragon King.

On his way he ran right into the Bodhisattva of South Sea. “Sun Wukong,” said
the Bodhisattva, “why did you not listen to me and accompany the Tang Monk? What
are you doing here?” Pilgrim was so taken aback that he saluted her on top of the
clouds. “I‟m most grateful for the kind words of the Bodhisattva,” he said. “A monk
from the Tang court did appear, lifted the seal, and saved my life. I became his disciple,
but he blamed me for being too violent. I walked out on him for a little while, but I‟m
going back right now to accompany him.”

“Go quickly then,” said the Bodhisattva, “before you change your mind again.”

They finished speaking and each went on his way. In a moment, our Pilgrim saw
the Tang Monk sitting dejectedly at the side of the road. He approached him and said,
“Master, why are you not on the road? What are you doing here?”
“Where have you been?” asked Tripitaka, looking up. “Your absence has forced
me to sit here and wait for you, not daring to walk or move.” Pilgrim replied, “I just
went to the home of the old Dragon King at the Eastern Ocean to ask for some tea.”
“Disciple,” said Tripitaka, “those who have left the family should not lie. It was
less than an hour since you left me, and you claim to have had tea at the home of the
Dragon King?”

“To tell you the truth,” said Pilgrim, laughing, “I know how to cloud somersault,
and a single somersault will carry me one hundred and eight thousand miles. That‟s why

I can go and return in no time at all.”

Tripitaka said, “Because I spoke to you a little sharply, you were offended and
left me in a rage. With your ability, you could go and ask for some tea, but a person like
me has no other prospect but to sit here and endure hunger. Do you feel comfortable
about that?”

“Master,” said Pilgrim, “if you‟re hungry, I‟ll go beg some food for you.”
“There‟s no need to beg,” said Tripitaka, “for I still have in my bag some dried
goods given to me by the mother of Guardian Liu. Fetch me some water in that bowl. I‟ll eat some food and we can start out again.” Pilgrim went to untie the bag and found
some biscuits made of unrefined flour, which he took out and handed over to the master.
He then saw light glowing from a silk shirt and a flower cap inlaid with gold. “Did you
bring this garment and cap from the Land of the East?” he asked. “I wore these in my
childhood,” said Tripitaka nonchalantly. “If you wear the hat, you‟ll know how to recite
scriptures without having to learn them; if you put on the garment, you‟ll know how to
perform rituals without having to practice them.”

“Dear Master,” said Pilgrim, “let me put them on.”

“They may not fit you,” said Tripitaka, “but if they do, you may wear them.”
Pilgrim thereupon took off his old shirt made of white cloth and put on the silk shirt,
which seemed to have been made especially for him. Then he put on the cap as well.
When Tripitaka saw that he had put on the cap, he stopped eating the dried goods and
began to recite the Tight-Fillet Spell silently.

“Oh, my head!” cried Pilgrim. “It hurts! It hurts!”

The master went through the recitation several times without ceasing, and the
pain was so intense that Pilgrim was rolling on the ground, his hands gripping the
flower cap inlaid with gold. Fearing that he might break the gold fillet, Tripitaka
stopped reciting and the pain ceased. Pilgrim touched his head with his hand and felt
that it was tightly bound by a thin metal band; it could be neither pulled off nor ripped
apart, for it had, as it were, taken root on his head. Taking the needle out of his ear, he
rammed it inside the fillet and started prying madly. Afraid that he might break the fillet
with his prying, Tripitaka started his recitation again, and Pilgrim‟s head began to hurt
once more. It was so painful that he did cartwheels and somersaults. His face and even
his ears turned red, his eyes bulged, and his body grew weak. When the master saw his
appearance, he was moved to break off his recitation, and the pain stopped as before.

“My head,” said Pilgrim, “the master has put a spell on it.”

“I was just saying the Tight-Fillet Sūtra,” said Tripitaka. “Since when did I put a
spell on you?”

“Recite it some more and see what happens,” said Pilgrim. Tripitaka accordingly
began to recite, and the Pilgrim immediately started to hurt. “Stop! Stop!” he cried. “I
hurt the moment you begin to recite.
How do you explain that?”

“Will you listen now to my instructions?” asked Tripitaka. “Yes, I will,” replied
Pilgrim. “And never be unruly again?”

“I dare not,” said Pilgrim.

Although he said that with his mouth, Pilgrim's mind was still devising evil.
One wave of the needle and it had the thickness of a rice bowl; he aimed it at the Tang
Monk and was about to slam it down on him. The priest was so startled that he went
through the recitation two or three more times. Falling to the ground, the monkey threw
away the iron rod and could not even raise his hands.

“Master,” he said, “I‟ve learned my lesson! Stop! Please stop!”

“How dare you be so reckless,” said Tripitaka, “that you should want to strike
me?”

“I wouldn‟t dare strike you,” said Pilgrim, “but let me ask you something. Who
taught you this magic?”

“It was an old woman,” said Tripitaka, “who imparted it to me a few moments
ago.”

Growing very angry, Pilgrim said, “You needn't say anything more! The old
woman had to be that Guanshiyin! Why did she want me to suffer like this? I‟m going
to South Sea to beat her up!”

“If she had taught me this magic,” said Tripitaka, “she had to know it even
before I did. If you go looking for her, and she starts her recitation, won‟t you be dead?”
Pilgrim saw the logic of this and dared not remove himself. Indeed, he had no
alternative but to kneel in contrition and plead with Tripitaka, saying, “Master, this is
her method of controlling me, allowing me no alternative but to follow you to the West.
I‟ll not go to bother her, but you must not regard this spell as a plaything for frequent
recitation either! I‟m willing to accompany you without ever entertaining the thought of
leaving again.”

“If that‟s so,” said Tripitaka, “help me onto the horse and let‟s get going.”

At that point, Pilgrim gave up all thoughts of disobedience or rebellion. Eagerly
he tugged at his silk shirt and went to gather the luggage together, and they headed
again toward the West. We do not know what is to be told after their departure; let‟s
listen to the explanation in the next chapter.
