NINETY-NINE
Nine times nine ends the count and Māra's all destroyed
The work of three times three done, the Dao reverts to its root
We shall not speak of the Eight Vajra Guardians escorting the Tang Monk back
to his nation. We turn instead to those Guardians of the Five Quarters, the Four
Sentinels, the Six Gods of Darkness and the Six Gods of Light, and the Guardians of
Monasteries, who appeared before the triple gates and said to the Bodhisattva Guanyin,
“Your disciples had received the Bodhisattva's dharma decree to give secret protection
to the sage monk. Now that the work of the sage monk is completed, and the
Bodhisattva has returned the Buddhist Patriarch's golden decree to him, we too request
permission from the Bodhisattva to return your dharma decree to you.”
Highly pleased also, the Bodhisattva said, “Yes, yes! You have my permission.”
Then she asked, “What was the disposition of the four pilgrims during their journey?”
“They showed genuine devotion and determination,” replied the various deities,
“which could hardly have escaped the penetrating observation of the Bodhisattva. The
Tang Monk, after all, had endured unspeakable sufferings. Indeed, all the ordeals that he
had to undergo throughout his journey have been recorded by your disciples. Here is the
complete account.” The Bodhisattva started to read the registry from its beginning, and
this was the content:

The sage monk's ordeals are clearly on file.
After the Bodhisattva had read through the entire registry of ordeals, she said
hurriedly, “Within our gate of Buddhism, nine times nine is the crucial means by which
one returns to perfection. The sage monk has undergone eighty ordeals. Because one
ordeal, therefore, is still lacking, the sacred number is not yet complete.”
At once she gave this order to one of the Guardians: “Catch the Vajra Guardians
and create one more ordeal.”
Having received this command, the Guardian soared toward the east astride the
clouds. After a night and a day he caught the Vajra Guardians and whispered in their
ears, “Do this and this . . . ! Don't fail to obey the dharma decree of the Bodhisattva.”
On hearing these words, the Eight Vajra Guardians immediately retrieved the wind that
had borne aloft the four pilgrims, dropping them and the horse bearing the scriptures to
the ground. Alas! Truly such is
Nine times nine, hard task of immortality!
Firmness of will yields the mysterious key.
By bitter toil you must the demons spurn;
Cultivation will the proper way return.
Regard not the scriptures as easy things.
So many are the sage monk's sufferings!
Learn of the old, wondrous Kinship of the Three:
Elixir won't gel if there's slight errancy.
When his feet touched profane ground, Tripitaka became terribly frightened.
Eight Rules, however, roared with laughter, saying, “Good! Good! Good! This is
exactly a case of „More haste, less speed'!”
1302
1302
“Good! Good! Good!” said Sha Monk. “Because we've speeded up too much,
they want us to take a little rest here.”
“Have no worry,” said the Great Sage. “As the proverb says,
For ten days you sit on the shore;
In one day you may pass nine beaches.”
“Stop matching your wits, you three!” said Tripitaka. “Let's see if we can tell
where we are.” Looking all around, Sha Monk said, “I know the place! I know the
place! Master, listen to the sound of water!”
Pilgrim said, “The sound of water, I suppose, reminds you of your ancestral
home.”
“Which is the Flowing-Sand River,” said Eight Rules.
“No! No!” said Sha Monk. “This happens to be the Heaven-Reaching River.”
Tripitaka said, “O Disciples! Take a careful look and see which side of the river
we're on.” Vaulting into the air, Pilgrim shielded his eyes with his hand and took a
careful survey of the place before dropping down once more.
“Master,” he said, “this is the west bank of the Heaven-Reaching River.”
“Now I remember,” said Tripitaka. “There was a Chen Village on the east bank.
When we arrived here that year, you rescued their son and daughter. In their gratitude to
us, they wanted to make a boat to take us across. Eventually we were fortunate enough
to get across on the back of a white turtle. I recall, too, that there was no human
habitation whatever on the west bank. What shall we do this time?”
“I thought that only profane people would practice this sort of fraud,” said Eight
Rules.
“Now I know that even the Vajra Guardians before the face of Buddha can
practice fraud! Buddha commanded them to take us back east. How could they just
abandon us in midjourney? Now we're in quite a bind! How are we going to get
across?”
“Stop grumbling, Second Elder Brother!” said Sha Monk. “Our master has
already attained the Way, for he had already been delivered from his mortal frame
previously at the Cloud-Transcending Ferry. This time he can't possibly sink in water.
Let's all of us exercise our magic of Displacement and take Master across.”
“You can't take him over! You can't take him over!” said Pilgrim, chuckling to
himself. Now, why did he say that? If he were willing to exercise his magic powers and
reveal the mystery of flight, master and disciples could cross even a thousand rivers. He
knew, however, that the Tang Monk had not yet perfected the sacred number of nine
times nine. That one remaining ordeal made it necessary for them to be detained at the
spot.
As master and disciples conversed and walked slowly up to the edge of the
water, they suddenly heard someone calling, “Tang Sage Monk! Tang Sage Monk!
Come this way! Come this way!” Startled, the four of them looked all around but could
not see any sign of a human being or a boat. Then they caught sight of a huge, white,
scabby-headed turtle at the shoreline. “Old Master,” he cried with outstretched neck, “I
have waited for you for so many years! Have you returned only at this time?”
1303
1303
“Old Turtle,” replied Pilgrim, smiling, “we troubled you in a year past, and
today we meet again.”
Tripitaka, Eight Rules, and Sha Monk could not have been more pleased. “If
indeed you want to serve us,” said Pilgrim, “come up on the shore.” The turtle crawled
up the bank. Pilgrim told his companions to guide the horse onto the turtle's back. As
before, Eight Rules squatted at the rear of the horse, while the Tang Monk and Sha
Monk took up positions to the left and to the right of the horse. With one foot on the
turtle's head and another on his neck, Pilgrim said, “Old Turtle, go steadily.”
His four legs outstretched, the old turtle moved through the water as if he were
on dry level ground, carrying all five of them— master, disciples, and the horse—
straight toward the eastern shore. Thus it is that
In Advaya's gate will Dharma profound
Reveal Heav'n and Earth and demons confound.
The original visage now they see;
Causes find perfection in one body.
Freely they move when Triyāna's won,
And when the elixir's nine turns are done.
The luggage and the staff there's no need to tote,
Glad to return on old turtle afloat.
Carrying the pilgrims on his back, the old turtle trod on the waves and proceeded
for more than half a day. Late in the afternoon they were near the eastern shore when he
suddenly asked this question: “Old Master, in that year when I took you across, I
begged you to question Tathāgata, once you got to see him, when I would find my
sought-after refuge and how much longer would I live. Did you do that?”
Now, that elder, since his arrival at the Western Heaven, had been preoccupied
with bathing in the Jade Perfection Abbey, being renewed at Cloud-Transcending Ferry,
and bowing to the various sage monks, Bodhisattvas, and Buddhas. When he walked up
the Spirit Mountain, he fixed his thought on the worship of Buddha and on the
acquisition of scriptures, completely banishing from his mind all other concerns. He did
not, of course, ask about the allotted age of the old turtle. Not daring to lie, however, he
fell silent and did not answer the question for a long time.
Perceiving that Tripitaka had not asked the Buddha for him, the old turtle shook
his body once and dove with a splash into the depths. The four pilgrims, the horse, and
the scriptures all fell into the water as well. Ah! It was fortunate that the Tang Monk had
cast off his mortal frame and attained the Way. If he were like the person he had been
before, he would have sunk straight to the bottom. The white horse, moreover, was
originally a dragon, while Eight Rules and Sha Monk both were quite at home in the
water. Smiling broadly, Pilgrim made a great display of his magic powers by hauling
the Tang Monk right out of the water and onto the eastern shore. But the scriptures, the
clothing, and the saddle were completely soaked.
Master and disciples had just climbed up the riverbank when suddenly a violent
gale arose; the sky darkened immediately and both thunder and lightning began as rocks
and grit flew everywhere. What they felt was
One gust of wind
And the whole world teetered;
One clap of thunder
And both mountains and streams shuddered.
1304
1304
One flash of lightning
Shot flames through the clouds;
One sky of fog
Enveloped this great Earth.
The wind's mighty howl;
The thunder's violent roar;
The lightning's scarlet streaks;
The fog blanking moon and stars.
The wind hurtled dust and dirt at their faces;
The thunder sent tigers and leopards into hiding;
The lightning raised among the fowl a ruckus;
The fog made the woods and trees disappear.
That wind caused waves in the Heaven- Reaching River to toss and churn;
That lightning lit up the Heaven- Reaching River down to its bottom;
That thunder terrified the Heaven- Reaching River's dragons and fishes;
That fog covered the shores of Heaven- Reaching River with a shroud of darkness.
Marvelous wind!
Mountains cracked as pines and bamboos toppled.
Marvelous thunder!
Its power stirred insects and injured humans.
Marvelous lightning!
Like a gold snake it brightened both land and sky.
Marvelous fog!
It surged through the air to screen the Ninefold Heaven.
So terrified were the pilgrims that Tripitaka held firmly to the scripture wraps
and Sha Monk threw himself on the poles. While Eight Rules clung to the white horse,
Pilgrim wielded his iron rod with both hands to give protection left and right. That
wind, fog, thunder, and lightning, you see, had been a storm brought on by invisible
demons, who wanted to snatch away the scriptures the pilgrims had acquired. The
commotion lasted all night, and only by morning did the storm subside. Soaked from
top to bottom and shaking all over, the elder said, “Wukong, how did this storm come
about?”
“Master, you don't seem to understand,” said Pilgrim, panting heavily, “that
when we escorted you to acquire these scriptures, we had, in fact, robbed Heaven and
Earth of their creative powers. For our success meant that we could share the age of the
universe; like the light of the sun and moon, we would enjoy life everlasting for we had
put on an incorruptible body. Our success, however, had also incurred the envy of
Heaven and Earth, the jealousy of both demons and gods, who wanted to snatch away
the scriptures from us. They could not do so only because the scriptures were
thoroughly wet and because they had been shielded by your rectified dharma-body,
which could not be harmed by thunder, lightning, or fog. Moreover, old Monkey was
brandishing his iron rod to exercise the nature of pure yang and give you protection.
Now that it is morning, the forces of yang are evermore in ascendancy, and the demons
cannot prevail.”
Only then did Tripitaka, Eight Rules, and Sha Monk realize what had taken
place, and they all thanked Pilgrim repeatedly. In a little while, the sun was way up in
the sky, and they moved the scriptures to high ground so that the wraps could be opened
and their contents dried. To this day the boulders have remained on which the scriptures
1305
1305
were spread out and sunned. By the side of the boulders they also spread out their own
clothing and shoes. As they stood, sat, or jumped about, truly this was their situation:
The one pure yang body facing the light
Has put invisible demons all to flight.
Know that true scriptures will o'er water prevail.
They fear not the thunder-and-lightning assail.
Henceforth to Sambodhi they'll go in peace,
And to fairy land they'll return with ease.
Rocks for sunning scriptures are still found here,
Though no demon would ever dare come near.
The four of them were examining the scriptures scroll by scroll to see if they had
completely dried when some fishermen arrived at the shore. When they saw the
pilgrims, one of the fishermen recognized them and said, “Old Masters, aren't you the
ones who crossed this river some years ago on your way to the Western Heaven to seek
scriptures?”
“Indeed, we are!” replied Eight Rules. “Where are you from? How is it that you
recognize us?”
“We are from the Chen Village,” said the fisherman. “How far is the village
from here?” asked Eight Rules.
The fisherman said, “Due south of this canal, about twenty miles.”
“Master,” said Eight Rules, “let's move the scriptures to the Chen Village and
dry them there. They have a place for us to sit and food for us to eat. We can even ask
their family to starch our clothing. Isn't that better than staying here?”
“Let's not go there,” replied Tripitaka. “As soon as the scriptures are dried here,
we can collect them and be on our way.”
The fishermen, however, went back south of the canal and ran right into Chen
Cheng. “Number Two,” they cried, “the masters who offered themselves as sacrificesubstitutes for your children years ago have returned.”
“Where did you see them?” asked Chen Cheng.
Pointing with their hands, the fishermen said, “Near the boulders over there,
where they're sunning scrolls of scriptures.”
Chen Cheng took some of his farmhands and ran past the canal. When he caught
sight of the pilgrims, he hurriedly went to his knees and said, “Venerable Fathers, now
that you have returned, having accomplished your work and merit of acquiring
scriptures, why did you not come straight to our home? Why are you loitering here
instead? Please, please come to our home!”
“Wait till we've dried the scriptures in the sun,” said Pilgrim, “and we'll go with
you.”
“How is it,” asked Chen Cheng again, “that the clothing and scriptures of the
venerable fathers are soaking wet?”
“In that previous year,” replied Tripitaka, “we were indebted to a white turtle for
taking us on his back to the western shore. This time he again offered to carry us back to
the eastern shore. When we were about to reach the bank, he asked me whether I had
remembered to inquire of Buddha for him about how much longer it would take for him
1306
1306
to achieve human form. I had actually forgotten about the matter, and he dove into the
water. That was how we got wet.”
After Tripitaka had thus given a thorough account of what had taken place, Chen
Cheng kowtowed and urged them to go back to the house. At length Tripitaka gave in,
and they began to collect the scriptures together. They did not expect, however, that
several scrolls of the Buddha-carita-kāvya Sūtra would be stuck to the rocks, and a part
of the sūtra's ending was torn off. This is why the sūtra today is not a complete text, and
the top of that particular boulder on which the sūtra had dried still retains some traces of
writing. “We've been very careless!” said Tripitaka sorrowfully. “We should have been
more vigilant.”
“Hardly! Hardly!” said Pilgrim, laughing. “After all, even Heaven and Earth are
not perfect. This sūtra may have been perfect, but a part of it has been torn off precisely
because only in that condition will it correspond to the profound mystery of nonperfection. What happened isn't something human power could anticipate or change!”
After master and disciples had finished packing up the scriptures, they headed for the
village with Chen Cheng.
The news of the pilgrims' arrival was passed from one person to ten, from ten to
a hundred, and from a hundred to a thousand, till all the people, old and young, came to
receive them. When Chen Qing got the news, he immediately set up an incense altar in
front of his door and called for drummers and musicians to play. The moment they
arrived, Chen led his entire household to kowtow to the pilgrims so as to thank them
once more for their previous kindness of saving their children. Then he ordered tea and
maigre for them.
Since Tripitaka had partaken of the immortal victuals prepared for him by the
Buddhist Patriarch, and since he had been delivered from his mortal frame to become a
Buddha, he had no desire at all for profane food. The two old men begged and begged,
and only to please them did he pick up the merest morsel. The Great Sage Sun, who
never ate much cooked food anyway, said almost immediately, “Enough!” Sha Monk
did not show much appetite either. As for Eight Rules, even he did not resemble his
former self, for he soon put down his bowl.
“Idiot, aren't you eating anymore?” asked Pilgrim.
“I don't know why,” said Eight Rules, “but my stomach seems to have
weakened all at once!” They therefore put away the food, and the two old men asked
about the enterprise of scripture seeking. Tripitaka gave a thorough account of how they
bathed at the Jade Perfection Abbey first, how their bodies turned light and agile at the
Cloud-Transcending Ferry, how they bowed to Tathāgata at Thunderclap, and how they
were feted beneath the precious tower and received scriptures at the treasure loft. He
then went on to tell how the two Honored Ones, failing to obtain a gift at first, gave
them wordless scriptures instead, how the second audience with Tathāgata had resulted
in acquiring a canonical sum of scriptures, how the white turtle dove into the water, and
how invisible demons tried to rob them. After this detailed rehearsal, he immediately
wanted to leave.
The entire household of the two old men, of course, absolutely refused to let
them go. “We could never have repaid,” they said, “your profound kindness in saving
the lives of our son and daughter except by building a temple to your memory. We have
named it the Life-Saving Monastery so that we might offer you the perpetual sacrifice
of incense.”
1307
1307
Then they called Chen Guanbao and One Load of Gold, the son and daughter for
whom Pilgrim and Eight Rules originally served as substitutes on that occasion of
childsacrifice, to come out to kowtow again to their benefactors before they invited the
pilgrims to view the monastery.
Leaving the scripture-wraps in front of their family hall, Tripitaka recited a
scroll of the Precious Permanence Sūtra for their entire household. When they reached
the monastery, food had already been laid out there by the Chen family. Hardly had they
been seated than another banquet was sent in by another family. Before they could even
raise their chopsticks, still another banquet was brought in.
There seemed, in fact, to be an unending stream of visitors and food vying for
the pilgrims' attention. Not wishing to decline such sincere display of the people's
hospitality, Tripitaka forced himself to make some show of tasting what was set before
him. That monastery, by the way, was a handsome building indeed.
The temple's bright red-painted doors
Reflect the work of all donors.
From that moment one edifice would rise
With two porticoes adding to its size.
Screens and casements scarlet;
Seven treasures exquisite.
Incense and clouds interlace
As pure light floods the airy space.
A few young cypresses need water still:
Pines have yet to form clusters on the hill.
A living stream in front
Reaches Heaven with its tossing billows;
A tall ridge behind,
The mountain range through which the earth pulse flows.
After he had looked at the monastery from the outside, Tripitaka then went up to
the tall tower, where he found the four statues of himself and his disciples.
When Eight Rules saw these, he gave Pilgrim a tug and said, “Your statue looks
very much like you!”
“Second Elder Brother,” said Sha Monk, “yours has great resemblance, too. But
Master's seems to look even more handsome.”
“It's about right! It's about right!” said Tripitaka, and they descended the tower.
In the front hall and the rear corridor, more vegetarian dishes were laid out for them.
Pilgrim asked the Chens, “Whatever happened to the shrine of that Great King?”
“It was pulled down that very year,” replied the two old men. “Since this
monastery was built, Venerable Father, we have been enjoying a rich harvest every
year. This has to be the blessing you bestowed on us.”
“It's actually the gift of Heaven!” said Pilgrim, chuckling. “We have nothing to
do with it. But after we leave this time, we shall try to give you all the protection we
can, so that the families of your entire village may enjoy abundant posterity, the
peaceful births of the six beasts, and annually wind and rain in due season.” All the
people kowtowed again to express their thanks.
1308
1308
Before and behind the monastery, there seemed to have gathered a numberless
crowd all wanting to offer fruits and maigre to their benefactors. With a giggle Eight
Rules said, “It's just my lousy luck! At the time when I could eat, there wasn't a single
household that would give me ten meals. Today I have no appetite, but one family after
another is pressing me with invitations.”
Though he felt stuffed, he raised his hands slightly and once more devoured
eight or nine platters of vegetarian food. Though he claimed his stomach had weakened,
he nonetheless put away twenty or thirty buns. The pilgrims all ate to their fullest
capacity, but still there were other households waiting to invite them. “What
contribution have these disciples made,” said Tripitaka, “that we should receive such
great outpouring of your affection? I beg you all to call a halt tonight. Wait till
tomorrow and we shall be glad to be the recipients again.”
It was already deep in the night. As he wanted to guard the true scriptures,
Tripitaka dared not leave. He remained seated below the tower and meditated, so as to
watch his possessions. By about the hour of the third watch, Tripitaka whispered,
“Wukong, the people here have already perceived that we have finished our enterprise
and attained the Way. As the ancients put it,
The adept does not show himself;
He who shows himself is no adept.
If they detain us too long, I fear that we may lose out in our main enterprise.”
“What you say is quite right, Master,” replied Pilgrim. “While it is still deep in
the night and people are all sound asleep, let us leave quietly.” Eight Rules now had
become quite alert, and Sha Monk was most understanding. Even the white horse
seemed to know their thoughts. They all arose, silently loaded the packs on the saddle,
took up the poles, and toted their belongings through the corridor.
When they reached the monastery gate, they found it padlocked. Using his
magic, Pilgrim opened the locks on both the second-level gate and the main gate. As
they were searching for the way toward the East, a voice rang out in midair. “You who
are fleeing,” cried the Eight Vajra Guardians, “follow us!” As the elder smelled a
strange fragrance, he rose with the others into the wind. Truly
Elixir formed, he knows the original face;
His healthy frame, natural and free, bows to his lord.
We do not know how he finally managed to see the Tang emperor; let's listen to
the explanation in the next chapter.
